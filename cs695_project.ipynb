In 2006, years of campaigning by Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation led to the EU adopting the world’s first legally binding regulation for controlling the trade in the ‘tools of torture’. ## Why do governments torture?

            "[61/185] Summarizing: Should Adopted Children Be Involved with Their Birth Families?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 214]: Before the advent of open adoption, adoptive families often worried that contact with a placed child’s birth family would hinder the development of relationships with their adoptive family. Decades-long studies have shown that this fear was unfounded. Adopted children who interact with their birth families feel integrated into their adoptive families and regard their adoptive parents as their mother and father. In some cases, the possibility of forming some kind of relationship with their birth family may create a sense of an “extended family” and, thus, mitigates adoptees’ yearning to search for their roots. Whereas closed adoptions have been shown to promote birth-family fantasies in children and adolescents, an adoptee’s interaction with biological family helps the placed child develop a realistic idea of their birth family, and thereby form a more authentic and positive self-identity as an adopted person\n",
            "[Doc 1093]: Contact between adoptive families and birth families has been shown to relieve stress for parents , birth and adoptive alike. Open adoption may reduce fear and even guilt for the birth parent(s) by allowing for the burning questions that so often accompany adoption to find real answers: “Did the child I placed go to a good home?” The birth family will get comfort from seeing and knowing that the adoption decision they made was the right one. Adoptive parents have also described the stress-reducing benefits for all, including the fact that the adopted child will never have to wonder where he/she came from, why he or she was put up for adoption, or what his/her birth family is like. To be sure, the confidence supplied to all parents through open adoption creates a positive environment for adoptees.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 68]: Simply put, birth parents of children put up for adoption have not signed on to be parents. As such, there is no guarantee that even if they desire some contact with the child they placed, that they will commit to the relationship (or be a source of emotional comfort to the child) in the long-term. Birth parents withdraw from open adoption relationships with much more frequency than adoptive parents. When a birth parent is only sporadically involved or disappears altogether, the emotional consequences, i.e., a deep sense of rejection , for children can be devastating. As one adoption advocate puts it, “A child whose biological parent disappears experiences a double whammy. He wonders why he was placed to begin with, then feels rejected again because a birth mother no longer visits.”\n",
            "[Doc 1491]: If birth is the crucial dividing-line we use to decide when legal personhood begins, then we should not be allowed to induce birth and then deliberately kill a foetus during that process - this is different from early abortion in which birth is induced and the foetus dies naturally. Partial-birth abortion is murder, even on the pro-choice understanding of personhood.\n",
            "[Doc 1517]: Numerous studies have shown that children do best when they are raised by two married, biological parents1. In the case of adopted children that is impossible, but a man and a woman is the best approximation of that family. Since that is the best environment to raise children, the government has to encourage and promote these traditional unions, not undermine them. Allowing gay couples to legally become parents, would legally and socially redefine what a family is and society as a whole may suffer. Children who are adopted already face bullying and exclusion in school because of their difference, placing them in same-sex households will double their exclusion and make their lives much harder than if placed in an opposite-sex household.\n",
            "[Doc 62]: Open adoption allows access to genetic and family medical history that is unavailable in closed adoptions. For adoptive families, knowledge of any medical or developmental problems among the birth family can help them to prepare and give better care to their child. This is especially the case if the birth mother engaged in an activity that may have adversely (or positively!) affected her baby’s health. For example, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are prevalent among children who are adopted from Eastern European countries, where there are high levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Without accurate family medical history, adoptees risk making crucial decisions about their health blindly or could end up paying for expensive diagnostic procedures or genetic testing in order to gain information that could be easily ascertained from the biological family.\n",
            "[Doc 379]: To better understand surrogacy, we must look at the alternatives available to people hoping to become parents. One alternative is adoption. Despite there being many children around the world in desperate need of homes, it can take years for a single child to be adopted. Then, adoptive parents must get to know a child who is already born and who biologically belongs to someone else. It may also be challenging to find out a comprehensive health history of the adopted child, which may cause complications later in life for everyone involved. Clearly, adoption is not easy. While the surrogacy process can also be challenging, especially when the surrogate mother is in a different country where war can break out , surrogacy does ensure that intended parents can be involved in their child’s life from the get-go. Intended parents are updated on the surrogate’s pregnancy, and often can attend scans and be present when the baby, often theirs biologically, is born.\n",
            "[Doc 2250]: Evidence suggests that children from lower-income families tend to “fall behind” further during long summer vacations. These children are less likely to read books, pursue additional studies or take part in useful extracurricular activities compared to their peers from wealthier families.\n",
            "[Doc 3771]: It is unfair that one person should start life with many more privileges for no reason other than birth. A counter argument is that non privileged children are rich in social and personal skills. However, this is not always the case.\n",
            "[Doc 2770]: Just because a mother gives birth to a child, and the parents financially support the child does not mean that they would try to control all aspects of the child's life. It should be remembered that while it the responsibility of the parents to care for their children, it does not mean that they treat their children like subordinates who must do as the boss (in this case the parents) say. However, it is true that children are in turn responsible towards their parents and should be grateful to their parents for all they have done for the sake of the child, it does not mean that the children would feel bound to abide by their parents rigid rules at all times. A child is a separate human being with different emotions and different states of mind and parents should consider that. Even though parents may adhere to strict parenting for the welfare of the child, the child should not be suffocated with excessive strictness and should be allowed enough space to grow on their own. A child is a different entity from the parents and should be respected and treated as such.\n",
            "[Doc 3119]: Increasingly we are confronted with alternative family structures which fail to meet the criteria for the traditional family model of two parents and two children. In a step-family the restriction on children may prove problematic should the new couple wish to add their own children to their existing families. Similarly, if a person enters a relationship with someone who has previously had two children, they will have to find someone else with whom to start a family. It would be increasingly difficult to enforce the limit in the case of multiple births; serious moral concerns would be raised if a woman was forced to select one or two children from those born.\n",
            "[Doc 324]: Having a baby is a rigorous experience that takes its toll on women’s physical and mental health. Paid maternity leave would allow these women the time needed to heal, or at least start healing. However, many women who have to return to work just a few days or weeks after giving birth have to lift heavy items and/or stand for long periods of time, even though this could be dangerous for their ongoing health. Even the increasing numbers of women who give birth by C-section often need to return to work before the recommended period of convalescence. Paid maternity leave has been found to lower the risks of post-partum depression. Being forced back to work by fear of losing their jobs or the financial pressure of living on one paycheck can seriously impact women’s health for years after giving birth. Not to mention, every extra month of maternity leave can be linked to a 13% reduction in the infant mortality rate. Society’s values of loyalty and responsible parenting should urge employers to stand by those who risk their physical and mental health to give birth to and nurture children , who are America’s future.\n",
            "[Doc 1720]: Social media has become the primary way in which children interact with their peers. These interactions are largely unsupervised by any adult, and yet they have a fundamental impact on the development of the children involved. Adolescents use social networking websites to gage peer opinion about themselves which may subsequently influence identity formation . With so much cyber bullying happening on such websites, and postings of inappropriate behaviour that may later surface to affect a student’s chances of getting into college or getting a job, it would be useful to have a teacher supervise these interactions to make sure no harm comes to the children involved.\n",
            "[Doc 3176]: Since the Labour domination in 1997, a lot has been made in the media of families who gain a lot of resources from the welfare state. Many people cite families that have vast amounts of children in order to gain more and more benefits. However, if we made breast feeding compulsory we could cut the level of benefits given to these families. If all of the nutrients that child needs are being gained for free, then less benefits would be needed in order to keep the child healthy. This would make people question whether or not scrounging off of the benefit system was a good idea with the benefit levels being so reduced. In this way, the child is not harmed.\n",
            "[Doc 548]: Many prisoners have children who are under the age of 18 , and these kids have no way to fight for representation of their own political interests. The number one advocates for children are their parents, but these parents can’t influence public policy regarding their children without being able to vote . There is evidence that children of parents with a criminal background are at higher risk of becoming criminals themselves. Therefore, it’s important for these children to know their parents are voting , because it provides them with a positive model of behavior of contributing to the betterment of society.\n",
            "[Doc 1504]: Surely providing a financial incentive for families to produce women causes women to be likened to a product that needs to be manufactured. Families will continue to have a social stigma against female children and they will be viewed simply as a financial asset. This is not only bad for women in general in the country but for babies that are only alive because they provide income. These children are unlikely to be loved and cared for as a male child might be and it is cruel to encourage them to be brought into the world to live life in such a condition. Furthermore, the commoditisation of money can only serve to worsen the problem of trafficking mentioned earlier by the proposition.\n",
            "[Doc 1568]: A parent who gambles can quickly lose the money their family depends on for food and rent. It is a common cause of family break-up and homelessness, so governments should get involved to protect innocent children from getting hurt . Each problem gambler harmfully impacts 10-15 other people . The internet makes it easy for gamblers to bet secretly, without even leaving the house, so people become addicted to gambling without their families realising what is going on until too late.\n",
            "[Doc 1518]: The focus of this debate should not be on gay rights, but on what is in the best interest of the adopted child. The adoption process' goal is to find the most suitable parents for that child, not to resolve other social inequalities and injustices. Being raised in a traditional family, by a mother and father, is the best environment for a child. Studies have shown that children who are raised by homosexual couples can have problems with substance abuse, violence and 'at risk' behaviour. Therefore the state has the obligation to try to provide the child with that environment.\n",
            "[Doc 1496]: Marriage promotes raising children as part of a monogamous couple. Without marriage, the frequency of single parent families would rise. Statistically, children who come from single parent families are more likely to live under the poverty line, more likely to be convicted of a criminal offence, more likely to become ill, less likely to complete every level of education and more likely to grow up to have low incomes themselves.\n",

For instance, Methuselah lived to the age of 969 according to the Bible, but maybe really only lived to 96, as age in the hundreds may have meant something else back then. This does not make the Bible a lie, rather it indicates that perhaps we need to shift gears and understand the Bible’s stories differently.\n",
            "[Doc 119]: In Corinthians , Paul bids women to “keep silence in the churches…And if [women] will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.” Why must women minimize their presence at church? Why should she be forbidden to speak, to ask questions, and ultimately, to interact with new (and presumably transformative) spiritual concepts? The Bible paints women as a gender best seen but not heard.\n",
            "[Doc 1090]: The Bible is not a book of heroes but rather a “how to” of what not to do. Nobody proves this principle more convincingly than the Bible’s men. Lot beds his own daughters. Jacob’s oldest sons slay an entire town (while the townsmen were recovering from circumcisions!) in their sleep and they sell their brother, Joseph , into slavery (and then lie about it). David sends one of his soldiers to certain death purely because he was interested in the soldier’s wife . Judas trades the son of God for thirty coins. Let’s compare these to women’s transgressions. Rachel steals idols from her father’s house, Moses’s sister Miriam is punished for gossiping about him, and some women have illicit affairs. At their worst, the sins of biblical females are almost heartwarmingly mild. If the Bible is the grand catalog of antisocial behaviors, it’s to women’s credit that they do not figure prominently in it.\n",
            "[Doc 334]: A great deal of ancient history that we regard as truth is comprised of various pieces of evidence that corroborate each other. The Bible gives us just that, in one book. Despite having been written by more than 40 different writers over a time span of about 2,000 years, the words of the Bible singularly echo a single voice. This indicates that the stories were passed down relatively accurately . Many Bible stories appear similarly, if not identically, in the books of the different monotheistic religions. The more texts that are collected that tell the same storyline, the greater and stronger their historical accuracy is believed to be. For example, Muslims agree with the other monotheistic faiths that Lot and his tribe were destroyed in the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah .\n",
            "[Doc 4106]: If quotas are helpful and they can help a business to become more productive, it should also be read as true that quotas would help all women in the workforce. As more women gain representation at the top of the ladder, more women will be seen as viable candidates for other roles. Remember, women aren't just underrepresented as C-level employees - they are underrepresented as leaders and managers throughout most organizations. Once you give a minority voice a place at the table, everyone under them is pulled up. This is a situation where a rising tide really does lift all boats. All one has to do is to look at businesses that have female CEOs to see the difference in workplace culture. It's hard to say that a woman doesn't have a place as a manage or a team leader, for example, if there is already a woman running the company. Mirroring is a basic part of instruction, so setting the tone for any place of work has to involve realistic demonstrations at the top. If there are no women leaders to look up to, there are going to be no examples for women to follow when they are working at lower levels of the company. Would a quota on boards help women in general? Not only would it put more women at higher positions, but it would help to get rid of any presumptions that a woman cannot lead. Setting quotas will directly lead to more diverse boards and better gender diversity.\n",
            "[Doc 1623]: How can it be assured the women entering African politics are representative of the women in that African nation? Further, will the leader implement politically popular ideas or required policies? If we are introducing quotas for women in politics we need to think about what women are entering. The concern with race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, and class is fundamental as if we accept the principle that an unrepresented group should get a quota of parliamentarians this should not just apply to women. We need to think about who the women are, what they represent, and who. Even for women simple quotas do not ensure effective representation of what all women want, or ensure the means for change. Women are heterogeneous, as are their challenges in life.\n",
            "[Doc 3484]: Some women find it necessary to exaggerate when it comes to a conflict with a man. They automatically assume that the conflict exists strictly because the two genders are involved. They also tend to think that if they can not do something(i.e. lift something heavy), that the other gender will think that women are weak. Sometimes women insist that they should get things on the grounds that they are women, and if they don't get it, then they assume it has to be because they are not men. They get rude with a man, because he opens the door for you. Saying, \"I am a women, that doesn't mean that I can't open a door for myself!\"\n",

She is a doer, a creator, and a fixture in her community, and yet, the comprehensive list of her undertakings isn’t out of the ordinary – they are the duties women have undertaken for centuries. The “wife of noble character” has no name, because she is every woman, and she is “worth far more than rubies.”\n",

Completely indiscreet women flashing their boobs for the tele whenever possible and then these tactless videos are bought and sold on the open market. The women who are successful, as you say, are clearly out numbered. The women get on the television, ads, billboards, etc. and say 'this is my worth', 'this is what you should think of women'. These images are flashed in front of the children several times a day. They may learn of these successfull women one day and think that it is a mere fluke, and normal women are to be seen and treated like they are displayed in the media. Instead of \"what's on your mind?\" it's\"show me your boobs, Hottie mama! \", and crotch shots all around.

            "[Doc 1622]: Including women in politics helps enable poverty to be tackled. Poverty is a women’s issue; women are more likely to live in poverty than men, and women are needed in politics to change this. Women understand each other, and what they need. Furthermore, although data varies, evidence shows gender inequalities remain intertwined to poverty and impoverishment . Women in positions of power and leadership can put the issues women face on the agenda and apply action. There is clearly a need to get women into politics to counter the current ‘boys club’ that exists in most countries where men help each other into positions of power squeezing out women and other methods of doing things.\n",
            "[Doc 1414]: Quotas attempting to maximise the number of educated and skilled women in executive positions could improve corporate performance and help raise national productivity. But doing so will depend on keeping ambitious, well-qualified women moving up the management ranks. Gender quotas will encourage more women to pursue education and career options leading to the top of executive positions. Quotas create incentives for women to adapt their job preferences to the more accessible boardroom positions and develop necessary skills which would reduce the need for positive discrimination in the future. Encouraged to develop relevant skills, women will contribute to the long-term talent pool and the economy. According to McKinsey report, women’s interest in being leaders increases as they progress from entry level to middle management  which is exactly what the principle behind quotas aims to encourage - more women following professional career development. This is very important in the short run during which, according to research, women who have high position stimulate other women’s interest in traditionally male-dominated sectors and encourage them to pursue similar career paths. \"Unlocking the Full Potential of Women in the US Economy.\"\n",

Women are often confined to the home by force, lack of opportunity or social stigma, on behalf of their husbands. When she is not paid, a housewife must rely on her husband for money, especially if she has children she is expected to take care of. Economic empowerment allows further freedom for women in countries where women are confined to the home . By making women economic actors, you empower them to engage in different social structures and hold a stake and position in the centres of economic power.

            "[Doc 324]: Having a baby is a rigorous experience that takes its toll on women’s physical and mental health. Paid maternity leave would allow these women the time needed to heal, or at least start healing. However, many women who have to return to work just a few days or weeks after giving birth have to lift heavy items and/or stand for long periods of time, even though this could be dangerous for their ongoing health. Even the increasing numbers of women who give birth by C-section often need to return to work before the recommended period of convalescence. Paid maternity leave has been found to lower the risks of post-partum depression. Being forced back to work by fear of losing their jobs or the financial pressure of living on one paycheck can seriously impact women’s health for years after giving birth. Not to mention, every extra month of maternity leave can be linked to a 13% reduction in the infant mortality rate.

For example, archaeological site surveyor Gila Cook discovered an inscribed stone within a newly excavated wall in Israel. This stone contains the first historical evidence of King David apart from in the Bible. In addition, the Temple Mount Sifting Project uncovered tile floors from the Jewish Temple, built by King Herod.

            "[Doc 1292]: Asha Jennings began a boycott of misogynistic music in hip-hop, resulting in the 'take back the music' campaign supported by essence magazine. Jennings claims that this type of rap/ hip hop music is 'telling people And that's exactly how society is treating us'1. She continues that images of women 'tends to be objectified, degrading, very stripper-like' or as nagging vicious and manipulative money grabbers1. Jennings' worry is that in these videos women are depicted as menial, subservient and purely as the object of men's entertainment. The lyrics that go with these music videos compound these ideas of women as undeserving of male respect e.g. 'wouldn't piss on fire to put you out' (Eminem), 'Then I straight smoked the ho and she thanked me' (NWE) (All lyrics in full are in the scrapbook). These images in themselves are violence towards women, as they dehumanise them. As this becomes a dominant image in society, young people who look up to these rappers mimic their behaviour and believe it is ok to disrespect women,2 as that is what they have been exposed to. This works in the same way for young girls, who cannot relate to the male rappers and so instead mimic the women they talk about, while also following their views on women. This idea that women are not deserving of respect must affect the levels of violence towards women as if you abuse someone you cannot fully respect them. Therefore if music depicting violence (and for this argument, disrespect) towards women was banned, then violence towards women in the real world would be reduced and this must be seen as a good thing.\n",
            "[Doc 2692]: Although our society has progressed to allow both men and women to have equal opportunities, it is hard to override the basic instincts that a man may have to act as a 'protector'. It can be said that if women were allowed on the front line then perhaps they would distract the men. Men may be more prone to look out for their female colleagues perhaps at the expense of their own life or others around them. There is also an issue of emotions clouding their judgement. If soldiers on the front line were mixed then it would be inevitable that relationships would be formed. This could lead to problems as soldiers will become more focused on the safety of their partner than on the job in hand. On the other hand, if a relationship ended badly, it would clearly affect their working lives. Another problem that was brought to my attention was the issue of hostages. Although women can be just as mentally strong etc as their male counterparts, there is a difference. Women, unfortunately, could be subjected to rape as well as torture while in the custody of our enemies. This leaves them with much more than physical scars which may never heal properly. Perhaps women should not be on the front line as men are perceived to be better at coping with the aftermath of torture and death. Everyone feels the pain when they lose one of their friends. The servicemen and women all live, eat, sleep, work together, creating a very strong bond between them. Men, however, might be able to cope better when faced with the loss of one of them than a woman. Women are stereotypically more sensitive and may struggle to separate themselves enough to ensure that no more losses are caused. Women should not be allowed on the front line as I believe that men would go out of their way to 'protect' their female colleagues which could endanger not only themselves and those around them, but it could jeoporadise their mission. Also, I do not believe that women can cope as easily as men when faced with torture and death. Thus, I fully support men and women being in the Armed Forces but the reasons above women should still be kept back from the front line.\n",

            "[Doc 3583]: As we’ve mentioned in our previous point, prostitution will take place whether it is legal or not. We believe prostitution should be legal. By regulating brothels and the conditions for prostitution through regular health checks, condoms et cetera, we can make sure prostitutes are safe from HIV. In places where prostitution is illegal, it is merely driven underground; controlled by cartels and gangs. In this situation prostitutes live under no rights. If a sex worker contracts AIDS, a man or woman client using them will be at risk of contracting the virus, they then run the risk of not knowing that they have it, infecting other sexual partners and the cycle continues. Also let us not forget future children who contract the disease while in the uterus. So it is in countries where prostitution is illegal where we can’t keep sex workers safe from AIDS. In these countries prostitutes aren’t even allowed to be prostitutes. They tend to enter the profession because they have no other way of earning money or they may be forced to do it. On the other hand, if prostitution is legal and regulations are put in place, sex workers will be safer from STI’s and HIV/AIDS. Regular health checks will pick up any possible infections and there will be laws to protect the well-being of sex workers. What’s more, these laws will not only protect sex workers, but their clients too. Making prostitution legal will improve the work conditions of people who have to go into prostitution for one reason or another and will protect society from a further spreading of HIV/AIDS. This is a signifcant benefit to greater society and individual workers and cl\n",
            "[Doc 3585]: The problem with the opposition proposal is that it is not mutually exclusive to legalising prostitution. It is perfectly possible for a Government to provide an education program and legalise prostitution at the same time, in fact that is what is done in places like New Zealand where prostitution is legal and we provide sex education in schools. In fact, legalising prostitution actually helps a wider education program. If the opp wants people to be properly educated about AIDS, then they should not want to exclude and stigmatise sex workers. If you continue to ban prostitution, then it actually entrenches the idea that prostitutes are somehow lesser people whose welfare we shouldn't care about when it comes to HIV. As it is, countries that ban prostitution make no effort to protect prostitutes at all. To have a free and open discussion, it is necessary to allow a free discussion about prostitution, which can only happen if it is legal. If it is not, it is much more difficult to acquire information about prostitutes and about the conditions in which they work, because they are less willing to come forward and admit to what they are doing. The opp has conceded that there is a problem of people having unsafe sex with prostitutes, and yet it seems like the only group of people they want to exclude from their education program are the prostitutes themselves. If we can identify who the prostitutes are, then we can educate them. If prostitution is illegal and forced underground, we can't provide them with info. In addition, we can't provide information with people who use prostitutes, both because they won't admit to committing an illegal act and because banning prostitution increases the stigma on these people. The prop has missed the point entirely when they say we will be unable to enforce regulation, because it will be in the interests of the prostitutes and brothels to abide by regulations and report those who don't.\n",
            "[Doc 427]: When the Netherlands legalized prostitution in 2000 , one of its main objectives was to curtail human trafficking and the criminal prostitution enterprise. In spite of its best intentions, illegal brothels still proliferated and prostitutes continued to suffer abuses at the hands of pimps. The government is continuing to try to clean up the Red Light District by relocating its sex workers, but they fear this forced change may further put their rights and safety at risk . Similarly, Nevada’s illegal prostitution industry is estimated to be about four times as large as its legal gambling enterprise. If legalization does not protect prostitutes , then it proves nothing more than a cynical revenue source for government.\n",
            "[Doc 1201]: The internet abounds with sex worker testimonials who attest to the satisfaction of a career in sex, and these personalities carefully draw a distinction between themselves and those who are coerced. Some prostitutes marvel at their great financial success and draw feelings of “empowerment” from their work. Stories of satisfied practitioners and customers beg the question: Why isn’t prostitution simply viewed as a normal business transaction? As the great variation in prostitution laws across the globe reflects, the illicit nature of prostitution is by no means an objective reality. And even if the ethical parameters of prostitution are unclear, free societies should, in principle, avoid restricting business transactions that do not harm individuals or society.\n",
            "[Doc 237]: The criminalization of prostitution leaves prostitutes on the fringes of society, making them vulnerable to violence, poverty, and health risks. Decriminalization allows sex workers to call the police in incidences of violence. In the Netherlands , decriminalizing prostitution gave sex workers access to social security and public health care. India’s union of sex workers improved prostitutes’ financial security by teaching them how to identify counterfeit bills . Sexually transmitted infections are also statistically lower in areas where prostitution is decriminalized. In rural Nevada, where prostitution is legal (and condoms and regular HIV tests mandatory), there has not been one case of HIV/AIDS diagnosed in a registered sex worker since 1986 . Beyond all the practical benefits, legalizing prostitution brings sex workers into the fold of society, increasing their sense of belonging, and thereby enhancing their feelings of responsibility toward others.\n",
            "[Doc 3597]: Women (and men) should be free to decide what they do with their own bodies. The state has no right to tell them they cannot make a living out of having consensual sex. If individuals are allowed to smoke, drink and even commit suicide without facing legal repercussions, then banning prostitution is simply hypocritical. Forced prostitution 'is' illegal ,which means the 'law' does not protect women/men from being forcibly solicited.People dying to be prostitutes cannot do so alone without facing the law, and therefore have to resort to large illegal criminal underground organisations, that exploit them.

Levitt, PhD, and published in the peer-reviewed , \"legalized abortion has contributed significantly to recent crime reductions.\" Around 18 years after abortion was legalized, crime rates began to drop abruptly, and crime rates dropped earlier in states that allowed abortion earlier. Because \"women who have abortions are those most at risk to give birth to children who would engage in criminal activity,\" and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments, crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion.\n",

It is easier to fix games in an unmonitored environment, in which money flows under the radar. Proof of such successful monitoring is the recent suspension of 5 NFL players who were caught violating the league’s gambling policy. Therefore, the common belief that legalizing sports betting will corrupt sports is wrong.\n",
            "[Doc 3600]: When we legalise something, it would be easier to monitor it. Making prostitution illegal will force the bussiness to go underground. This makes it harder for regulation to happen. Usually underground activities are hard to erase and their impact on the society is much worse. This bussiness would harbour women who have HIV. It would probably use teenage prostitutes. They would not have to worry about the use of condoms or other forms of protection. Human trafficking may happen because of its underground nature like what is happening in several countries. If we legalise prostitution we could actually have an eye out to prevent any of this from happening.\n",

The problem of paedophilia is already a rapidly growing one, made worse by its expansion into ‘related’ avenues such as child pornography.

They most definitely will be. It is important that prostitutes and safe and free from harm. There are many reasons why women go into prostitution. Often it is due to financial desperation and/or children commitments. These women are in a very vulnerable position and it is very important that we ensure they are as safe and healthy as can be. Prostitutes are subject to gangs, violence, drugs and rape. Prostitutes are often forced to take drugs by the gangs who employ (or own) them so as to make them addicted. This means they have no way to escape. When the market is legalised, it is no longer controlled by gangs. This is because legal businesses operate the industry instead. This is better for prostitutes as they no longer suffer the horrific abuses that they face under a system of illegal prostitution. This is because legal businesses face regulation. They are required by law to ensure that contraception is used by their employees. They are also required to ensure that their employees are healthy by directing them to appropriate medical treatment when it is necessary. When legal its easier to monitor. This is because the government knows how many prostitutes there are, where they are located, and what issues are affecting the industry. This is beneficial as the government can better plan appropriate health and social policies. Prostitutes are legitimate stakeholders that need protection. Under our model, we better protect prostitutes. They are safer, they are healthier, and they are happier\n",
            "[Doc 3599]: Just as the war on drugs has been an abysmal failure, the war on prostitution has merely led to a giant loss of tax dollars and police time.

            "[Doc 3786]: Many terrorist organizations are funded by the illegal drug trade, and the illegality of recreational drugs places them in the hands of criminal organizations (some of which rival large corporations) and street gangs, resulting in criminal activity which need not be associated with recreational drugs. Were recreational drugs to be legalized, these drug trade related crimes would be significantly reduced, and the profits made would be the profits of legal entities as opposed to criminal organizations.\n",
            "[Doc 1404]: In most cases, pornography is not entered into willingly. Similarly to prostitution, the sale of one’s own body and one’s dignity is so drastic that consent is often not sufficiently informed to be legitimate. There are patriarchal structures in society that force women into these industries, particularly when they are vulnerable and this seems to be a good last resort. This leads to a loss of integrity, a strong stigma in society, and most importantly, abusive conditions in the production process. As well as high risks of unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases, violent sex practices and abusive conditions after filming often occur (Lubben).

            "[Doc 415]: The fact that sex workers are 80% female cannot be overlooked, nor should the fact that a sizable portion of sex workers are coerced by physical means or by economic hardship. Female prostitutes are more likely to be raped or murdered than any other population . And so, by the necessity to protect themselves, either from physical harm or from destitution, an overwhelmingly female contingent of sex workers find themselves at the mercy of the men they serve. Cruelly, society blames women for the violence committed against them, often postulating how she might have brought the trouble on herself . The only way to oppose such attitudes (and realities) is to increase legal measures against those who perpetuate the prostitution industry.\n",
            "[Doc 3615]: In my opinion, smoking should be banned in public places. That is because non-smokers should not be forced to secondhand smoke against their will. Even though it is an obvious etiquette not to smoke when surrounded by many people, a large number of smokers don't seem to care so much about it. For example, it's not that hard to find a person smoking at a bus stop even if there are little girls around him/her. There should be rules restricting people who have little regard for the well-being of others. Another reason why smoking should be banned in public places is because of the garbage problem. Not many smokers throw away their cigarette butts into the trash cans. Most of them just toss it on the streets. The streets will be much cleaner if smoking is banned. However, smokers should not be treated unfairly. There should be more places where only smokers can smoke freely. Therefore smoking should be banned in public places but more smoking areas should be built as well.\n",

Teenage athletes train alongside adult ones and share the same coaches, so many would succumb to the temptation and pressures to use drugs, if these were widely available and effectively endorsed by legalization. Not only are such young athletes unable to make a fully rational, informed choice about drug-taking, the health impacts upon growing bodies would be even worse than for adult users. It would also send a positive message about drug culture in general, making the use of “recreational drugs” with all their accompanying evils more widespread.\n",

            "[Doc https://catwinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ten-Reasons-for-NOT-Legalizing-Prostitution.pdf]: Summary Since the mid-1980s, the debate about how to address prostitution legally has become a subject of legislative action Some countries in Europe, most notably the Netherlands and Germany among others, have legalized and/or decriminalized systems of prostitution, which includes decriminalizing pimps, brothels and buyers, also known as “customers or johns” Other governments, such as Thailand, legally prohibit prostitution activities and enterprises but in reality tolerate brothels and the buying of women for commercial sexual exploitation, especially in its sex tourism industry. In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).\n",
            "[Doc https://journals.law.harvard.edu/crcl/to-protect-women-legalize-prostitution/]: People believe that legalizing prostitution will only lead to the abuse of more women, will make it harder for prostitutes to get out of the industry, or will teach young women that their bodies exist for the sole purpose of sexual exploitation by men. Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.\n",

The overwhelming majority of sex workers are unable or unwilling to work under the conditions created by legalization, including applying for licenses, registering with local sheriffs, and working in one of the few brothels in rural Nevada, where workers are subject to their manager’s, county, and state rules. Even under the “legalization” model, Nevada has the highest prostitution arrest rate per capita, at 95.3 arrests per 100,000 residents.**2** This model may work for those who are able to participate, but it is not beneficial for all people engaged in the sex industry, nor does it carry broader public safety benefits that reach beyond the rural communities with brothels.

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 631]: Traveling with kids overseas shows them how important they are to you. When you take your kids with you on a trip abroad, it is a direct way of communicating your desire to spend time with them. And, when children feel valued, it fosters a great opportunity to bond as a family. Involving your children in trip-planning and introducing new and exciting global travel experiences into their lives will not only increase their decision-making skills but also their abilities to adapt to changing situations . It will also help them develop a sense of sense of self-worth. Not to mention that overseas trips together are a great way to reduce the void that kids feel when their parents travel without them.\n",
            "[Doc 1111]: When kids are young, the destination they travel to matters much less than the fact that they are going on a family outing. However, once they are tweens and teens , your children will begin to understand what a privilege overseas travel is and will become excited by the sights and cultures they encounter. This means that choices of destination can be more varied and exotic with older kids, as they’ll be more physically able to handle hiking to the top of volcanoes or scuba diving with dolphins. Also, giving your teens a taste of travel may lead them to volunteer abroad after high school, which is said to build character and impart vital skills.\n",
            "[Doc 1010]: Traveling with young kids overseas is physically difficult. Between schlepping them through crowded airports, having to keep them quiet during long flights, and getting them regulated to new time zones and cuisines, fine overseas travel can be exhausting and demanding. Plus, younger kids come with a lot of paraphernalia – from carrycots to booster seats, it’s a lot to pack up and carry. The younger the kids, the less mature and therefore less capable they will be of acclimating to new situations – and more likely to throw an overtired tantrum in the middle of Piccadilly Circus. While they may still feel the effects of jet lag, older children will better be able to handle its impact compared to their younger selves. Keep in mind that when older kids can’t sleep, they can at least entertain themselves; with young children, parents also have to endure sleepless nights.\n",
            "[Doc 683]: Overseas travel can thrust little kids out of their comfort zones. True, this may lead to meltdowns, but those moments do not represent the entirety of the children’s experiences. Spending time in different cultures lays the groundwork for teaching children through example how to communicate with diverse people. It also enables them to develop patience, as well as a greater appreciation for what the larger world outside their own has to offer. Additionally, it instills the value of experience over material possessions in them; they will learn that there exists a world beyond their screens.\n",
            "[Doc 1256]: Other successful schemes aim to work individually with young troublemakers, in order to cut their reoffending rate, for example by requiring them to meet with victims of crime so that they understand the consequences of their actions, and by pairing them with trained mentors. Overall, governments need to ensure good educational opportunities and employment prospects in order to bring optimism to communities where youngsters feel that their futures are pretty hopeless. Rather than trying to scare kids into good behaviour, why don’t we offer them a better life? Most areas with anti-social behaviour problems are poor, with bad schools, few jobs and little for kids to do with themselves. With little hope for the future, no wonder some kids go off the rails. So instead of threatening punishment, we should invest in better schools, places for kids to play and socialise, and the chance of a job.1 1.\n",

A spouse isn't completely trustworthy, they can turn abusive, they can secretly be manipulating you or pulling some kind of financial fraud against you. You always need things outside your marriage that you can use if it fails. Quite apart from that, when you get married you are still your own person, you can't let someone completely erode who you are. Your online presence should always be your own property because the Internet is for having a different identity, being anonymous, doing things you can't do in the offline world.

            "[Doc 1767]: Shooting as a sport desensitises people to the lethal nature of all firearms, creating a gun culture that glamorises and legitimises unnecessary gun ownership. It remains the interest of a minority, who should not be allowed to block the interests of society as a whole in gun control. Compensation can be given to individual gun owners, gun clubs and the retail firearms trade, in recognition of their economic loss if a ban is implemented.\n",
            "[Doc 994]: When the law meant to protect you, instead, turns you into prey, it’s understandable to want to take self-defense into your own hands. In Chicago, where there are bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, and where gun shops were banned until 2012, gun control laws are not proving effective. Though the city has some of the toughest gun restrictions in place, it suffers from rising gun and gang violence . The city’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is working to increase public safety, but has an uphill battle . Chicago is just one example of many cities where law-abiding citizens are paying the price – with their lives – of ineffective gun control laws.\n",
            "[Doc 1199]: Gun ownership exercises a fundamental individual right under the U.S. Constitution. For most upstanding citizens, owning a gun is as important to them as maintaining freedom of speech, the press, religion, among others. In fact, three quarters of gun owners believe that the right to bear arms is paramount to their freedom. No wonder gun owners take it personally when gun control laws appear to infringe on this right, thus impeding efforts to acquire firearms and protect themselves and their families. Plus, there’s the risk that certain proposed background checks may require government databases to keep gun owners’ personal information indefinitely. This could lead to future database searches unrelated to the information when it was first collected. This understandably can be perceived as an unfair invasion of privacy.\n",

            "[Doc 1268]: Internet access is not a fundamental right as recognized by any major human rights convention, if it can be called a right at all. After all, in a war zone few rights survive or can be upheld at all. Preventing such an outcome at the expense of the temporary curtailment of some lesser rights is entirely justified. Under current law, in most states, only the most fundamental of rights, like the right to life, prohibition against torture, slavery, and the right to a fair trial are regarded as inalienable .\n",
            "[Doc 1046]: If anything, gun restrictions are aimed at making the world safer by limiting guns from getting into the wrong hands. This leads to fewer deaths. Universal background checks on private and gun show sales, an issue that survivors of the February 2018 Parkland massacre helped push legislators to prioritize, can help prevent criminals and the mentally ill from getting guns. Research asserts that federal checks could cut gun deaths by an estimated 90%. And let’s not forget about mandatory safety features. Installing safety devices on guns would minimize accidental gun deaths, especially of and by children. Think about it: We have childproof caps on medicine bottles, so why not have childproof firearms?\n",
            "[Doc 1417]: Allowing teachers to carry arms in school could mean that very young children could easily become acclimatised to the idea that carrying a gun and ultimately gun usage is ok. Surely the way to prevent incidents like Columbine from happening is to teach children about the potentially destructive and fatal consequences of gun usage? For elementary/primary school-age children, it would be difficult to separate the idea that it’s ok for teachers to always carry guns but not for anyone else.\n",
            "[Doc 2519]: A Nov. 2009 peer-reviewed study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that someone carrying a gun for self-defense was 4.5 times more likely to be shot during an assault than an assault victim without a gun. According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, \"members of the public who carry guns risk escalating everyday disagreements into public shootouts, especially in places where disputes frequently occur—in bars, at sporting events, or in traffic.\" For example, on Jan 13, 2014, a retired police officer with a legally concealed handgun shot and killed another man during an argument over text messaging in a movie theater.\n",
            "[Doc 360]: Law enforcement agencies are constantly protecting civilians . Countless policemen have heroically saved others during shootings even at the expense of their own lives. Still, the police can’t always protect everyone everywhere all of the time, so firearms significantly contribute to gun owners’ sense of – and actual – safety. In a 1982-83 study , almost 2000 imprisoned felons in 10 states were surveyed about whether gun control prevented crime. More than half (57%) said that most criminals feared armed citizens more than the police. Additionally, 40% said they were deterred from carrying out their crime when they thought their potential victim was armed. It’s no surprise, then, that 57% of people feel that possessing a gun prevents them from being victimized.\n",
            "[Doc 1768]: There is a correlation between the laxity of a country’s gun laws and its suicide rate – not because gun owners are more depressive, but because the means of quick and effective suicide is easily to hand. As many unsuccessful suicides are later glad that they failed in their attempt, the state should discourage and restrict the ownership of something that wastes so many human lives.\n",
            "[Doc 1418]: Having guns in the classroom will more than likely increase the chances of gun related violence in schools. It would increase the chance of gun related accidents; although only a very small chance there would previously have been no chance. It may well also increase the number of shootings; people who carry guns are 4.5 times more likely to be shot,  although there is no way of knowing if the effect would be the same in the classroom as on the street. Finally it is ignoring the possibility that those who are to carry guns for the school children’s protection may at some point turn the gun on their charges. Teaching can be a very frustrating job and the teacher may get very angry with individual students, allowing teachers to carry guns would greatly increase the risk of an unpremeditated shooting against on a schoolchild.\n",
            "[Doc 2606]: According to David Lampo, Publications Director of the Cato Institute, \"there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates.\" Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The \"gun show loophole\" is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws.\n",

            "[Doc 1729]: The state incurs huge costs in monitoring for intellectual property right infringement, in arresting suspected perpetrators, in imprisonment of those found guilty, even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that, once released to it, belonged to the public domain. The United States government, for example, projects costs of investigating intellectual property claims will cost $429 million between 2009 and 20131. Firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products, in monitoring for infringement, and in prosecuting offenders, all of which generates huge costs and little or no return2. Furthermore, the deterrent effect to intellectual property piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal. This is because in many cases intellectual property rights are next to unenforceable, as the music and movie industries have learned in recent years. Only a tiny handful of perpetrators are ever caught, and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime, it does little to stop it. Intellectual property, in many cases, simply does not work in practice; firms should move with the times and recognize they need to innovate in ways that will compensate. \"PRO-IP Act Promises Increased Focus on IP Rights and Expanded Counterfeiting Remedies\". \"Emerging Issues in Intellectual Property\".\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 856]: Today, personal freedom is a treasured and widely held Western value. This extends to freedom of expression, which is a right that many people around the world still don’t have – and are fighting for. As we are blessed to live in a society which allows us to do with our bodies as we please, why shouldn’t this be celebrated? Like wearing makeup, styling hair or piercing various parts of your body, tattoos enhance self-esteem . In fact, a Texas Tech University study found that college-age women with four or more tattoos reported higher levels of self-esteem than anyone else in the study. Whether a sign of self-empowerment or a coping mechanism, tattoos have the power to make you feel good. This is especially the case for people who use medical tattoos to cover scars. Tattoos help people feel comfortable in their own skin.\n",
            "[Doc 569]: A study found that nearly one in three people with a tattoo regret getting one. Many get tattoos impulsively, and that spur-of-the-moment decision is often one of the biggest predictors of tattoo regret . While many people get tattoos to remind them of an event in their life that seemed significant at the time, that reminder may not serve them in their later years. Plus, symbols, which many people choose as a tattoo, change over time, or are appropriated for different agendas of various ideologies. For example, the swastika, which was once a positive symbol in almost every culture, became the threatening insignia of the Nazi party. Even the “OK” hand sign, intended to convey that everything is going well, was adopted by the alt-right as a divisive political statement. Whatever your tattoo is originally intended to mean, it may later turn into a regret or connote a questionable or more negative meaning – one with which you won’t want to be associated.\n",
            "[Doc 133]: As some sources estimate that between 44% of Americans have a tattoo, it’s difficult to stand by the reasoning that they aren’t socially acceptable anymore. While some still argue that tattoos are unprofessional, most tattoos – barring a full sleeve – are small and unobtrusive. The stigma against tattoos is fading fast, and if it no longer threatens your job security or social standing, why shouldn’t you get one if it interests you?\n",
            "[Doc 1122]: True, tattoos are pretty common – and commonly accepted – these days. And while attitudes toward them are more lenient in the workplace than they were in the past, there are still prejudices that can affect one’s job prospects in certain places of employment. One survey found that 75% of the 2,675 respondents felt that tattoos hurt an applicant’s chances of being hired while 39% felt that employees with tattoos reflected poorly on the employer. And some tattooed employees may face company dress-code policies that make them cover up visible body art. For them, claiming their First Amendment Right to free speech won’t help them win any cases against employers. This is because the First Amendment only prevents governments from abridging someone’s freedom of speech and expression; it does not extend to private employers and certainly not to their prejudices.\n",
            "[Doc 670]: Body art not only encourages a level of deep thinking about personal values and ideals, but also unites groups of people under intentional, positive messages. For example, as a way to deal with the coronavirus lockdowns – and celebrate emerging from them – coronavirus-related imagery , such as masks, doctors, and the virus particle, have become popular tattoos in recent years. Additionally, long before the pandemic, tattoos of the semicolon were adopted by the mental health community as a symbol of surviving depression and suicidal ideation. In another message of hope, hundreds of people across Manchester got a tattoo of a worker bee to show solidarity with survivors of the May 2017 terrorist attack. Or, like the nobility of ancient Egypt and the skilled women of Borneo, tattoos can be used as emblems that communicate deep ideas and positive information.\n",
            "[Doc 1091]: Schools teach students about the U.S. Constitution and its Amendments , so why not educate them to follow it? Everyone has a right to freedom of expression. For example, in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School (1969), the court said that a student’s freedom of expression in school must be protected unless it would seriously interfere with disciplinary requirements. In a school setting, this can and should be extended to exhibiting individuality through clothing. Forcing all students to wear the same thing infringes on this right. It can also stifle students’ self-expression, which is a strong need during adolescence. Uniforms go against teens’ natures and may drive them to express themselves through harsher means, such as body piercings, tattoos and rebellious behavior.\n",
            "[Doc 1867]: In some contexts, separation may not be a realistic option for minority peoples. However, that does not mean that self-determination is not meaningful for such groups. For indigenous peoples, self-determination may take the form of restitution for land that was stolen from them, or compensation and reparations. Furthermore, self-determination may take the form of political autonomy, or greater rights to decide how children are educated, or parallel systems of justice such as sharia courts. Self-determination is about representation and identity and choice - not about outcomes.\n",

            "[Doc 3068]: Every curse/swear has a cause and an effect. The cause and effect must be acknowledged when using these expressions. To swear is to utter obscenities, WordWeb's definition. An obscenity is offensive or indecent expression. An indecent expression does not meet the standards of what is right/good, for a reason It is wrong/bad because it both comes from (is associated with) an ill cause and causes an ill effect. The ill cause that leads to the swearing is the will to death/impotence as opposed to the will to life/power (to use partly from the philosophy of Nietzsche). Using a swear/curse word admits to a lack for a better choice of words, also a lack of meaning. Why not use a more accurate vocabulary/expression to communicate ideas? Why leave people to wonder what the meaning of your words is? Ill cause: hurt, lack of vocabulary or meaning, hate, anger, nothing good Ill effect: Expressing the causes above in not the best way, confusion, hurt, other ills.\n",
            "[Doc 1164]: The culture of irony has led us astray from actual art. Living in a culture that glorifies avocado tattoos does not make avocado tattoos a good idea, nor is it a testament to their artform. Just because something is loved does not make it quality, it only makes it popular. Fans’ morbid fascination with how bad the acting is in The Room doesn’t change the fact that viewers are left watching bad acting. Each cringe-evoking piece of dialogue and delivery is a testament to the movie’s lack of craftsmanship. The quality of The Room cannot be deemed good just because we live in a culture that thrives on irony.\n",
            "[Doc 2245]: Article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression\". Children's freedom of expression is restricted by school uniforms, because children who have to wear the same clothing as every other child in their school are not able to express their individuality and creativity. We should get rid of school uniform so that all children can express themselves freely.\n",
            "[Doc 1407]: Social movements should limit themselves to pushing for the rights of social groups, not restricting them. The feminist movement, as a social movement, should not limit the voices of women in the same way their oppressors have throughout history. Banning pornography would directly restrict the freedom of choice of women who want to manifest their sexuality and express themselves in revolutionary ways in art and media. Examples such as amateur and improvised porn, which are independent of a director, show the deep value of self-expression and self-definition women can find in this form of art. The desire of some actresses to become internationally recognised as ‘sex symbols’, become porn stars, or simply convey that sex is for women too, is a legitimate one, and not an act of desperation. This must be taken into account in cases of pornography between consenting adults, for consenting adults.\n",
            "[Doc 674]: From cancelling controversial campus lectures to banning the use of certain words, PC culture can put a damper on self-expression and plurality of perspectives, especially on college campuses today.

Some try to make people feel inferior if they don't have the product, or if they have something which the product would change. Perceptions of beauty and fashion in particular have been terribly distorted. Many young people have low self-esteem, and lead unhealthy lifestyles because they feel they should be thinner and more attractive like the models they see in adverts. This leads to serious problems like eating-disorders and self-harm.

And what about those who are mentally unwell?

            "[Doc 2114]: Journalists and editors use their judgement all the time on what is acceptable to print or broadcast. Expletives  or graphic images of violence or sex are routinely prevented because they would cause offence, giving personal details might cause distress and are omitted as a courtesy, and the identities of minors are protected as a point of law in most jurisdictions. It is simply untrue to suggest that journalists report the ‘unvarnished truth’ with no regard to its ramifications. Where a particular fact or image is likely to cause offence or distress, it is routine to exercise self-censorship – it’s called discretion and professional judgement . Indeed, the news outlets that fail to do so are the ones most frequently and vociferously denounced by the high-minded intelligentsia who so frequently argue that broadcasting issues such as this constitutes free speech. It is palpably and demonstrably true that news outlets seek to avoid offending their market; so liberal newspapers avoid exposés of bad behaviour by blacks or homosexuals otherwise they wouldn’t have a readership.\n",

However, this is a right guaranteed under international law. The International Court of Justice has held that this right applies not just to national governments but also people1. The two important United Nations studies on the right to self-determination set out factors of a people that give rise to possession of right to self-determination: a history of independence or self-rule in an identifiable territory, a distinct culture, and a will and capability to regain self-governance2. If these criteria are in place, such peoples should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangements.\n",

            "[67/185] Summarizing: Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 246]: A theory endorsed by both Bill Nye the Science Guy and Neil deGrasse Tyson , evolution is on the side of the egg as coming before the chicken. This is because there was once a proto-chicken – a bird resembling a chicken, but not quite of chicken status – that went about its business laying and fertilizing an egg. However, this egg carried some sort of genetic mutation that turned it into the chicken we have now come to know and love. Because the parents of the first chicken egg were birds that weren’t yet chickens, it appears that the egg did, indeed, come first. In addition, eggs of other birds predated chickens by millions of years, and there are fossils to prove it. The Archaeopteryx – largely accepted as the world’s oldest and first bird , and the closest living being of ancient times to resemble a chicken – left behind fossils from 150 million years ago, give or take. So, in comparison to other types of birds, chickens came rather late to the evolutionary party.\n",
            "[Doc 1207]: British scientists from Sheffield and Warwick universities are now convinced that the chicken preceded the egg, and they have the research to back it up. Their study follows the development of a chicken’s egg, concluding that chicken eggs can only form with the help of a protein found solely in the ovaries of a chicken. Additionally, chickens create eggs more quickly than other animals do, but they need the protein to help speed up the process. In other words, it is impossible for a chicken egg to form unless it has emerged from within a hen’s body.\n",
            "[Doc 253]: As the question which came first, the chicken or the egg, is paradoxical in nature, the answer may lie in the context. For instance, a look at our nutritional regimen, where eggs and chickens play their most dominant role in our lives, provides a clear answer: the egg came first. Our token first meal of the day typically consists of eggs, with poultry only nearing our plates during lunch or dinner. This basic breakfast etiquette originated with the Ancient Romans , and humans worldwide have been carrying the sensible tradition ever since.\n",
            "[Doc 71]: Whether you believe the Bible is divinely inspired or written by man, the world’s oldest, most-read and most oft-purchased book had enough wisdom to solve this chicken-egg mystery from the get-go. Right in the beginning of Genesis , the following is written: “And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind….And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.” In other words, before they could procreate, fowl – which includes chickens– had to already exist. So, to answer which came first, the chicken or the egg, look no further than the Bible: Animals came from nothing, and eggs came from animals.\n",
            "[Doc 363]: The recent advent of genetically modified chicken eggs suggests that in matters of science and medicine, eggs precede the chicken. Not intended for consumption, these eggs have been genetically engineered and contain a protein that plays a key role in fighting diseases like cancer, hepatitis and other immune-related illnesses. Japanese researchers have discovered a complex process to fertilize eggs that, long story short, produce male chicks that are crossbred with females to lay eggs containing the protein-producing cancer-fighting genes. The result, stemming solely from the egg, may reduce medicine production costs . This goes to show that when humans recreate nature, they have to start with the egg.\n",
            "[Doc 868]: When we think of dolls, the first brand to come to mind is most likely Barbie. Now think of mobile phones, did you think of Apple first? And what about soft drinks and fast food? Chances are high that Coca-Cola and McDonald’s first came to mind. Brand association is a big thing. There is a strong correlation between brand awareness and association and purchase decisions. By being the first brand to sell a product, if done right, you can make your brand name almost synonymous with the type of product (Kleenex or Band-Aid anyone?). The media is also more likely to cover a “first of” than a “slightly better” version.\n",
            "[Doc 595]: Chickens – like other birds – sit on their eggs for over three weeks to keep them warm and to protect them from external elements. In fact, baby chicks only form in eggs that have been incubated. Research shows that non-mother hens don’t take interest in eggs that aren’t their own and that they’re even inclined to destroy eggs of other species. In other words, chicken eggs need a mother hen to sit on them in order to hatch. If the egg had come first, who would have kept it warm enough to hatch?\n",
            "[Doc 426]: People tend to conform to the ideas they learned as children, not only because of the feelings of security generated at home, but also because first impressions make stronger imprints on the brain than those that follow. Studies have found that a first impression, once formed, is hard to undo. This is especially true if a subject or person is first presented to you in a negative light. For example, one study that appeared in Social Cognition showed that people who observed someone who had made a bad first impression were slow to believe she had changed for the better, even after weeks of seeing her perform kind acts.\n",
            "[Doc 165]: There were search engines before Google . There were navigation apps before Waze. There were even social media sites before Facebook . In a study conducted of 500 companies, the first mover (first to sell a product) had a failure rate of 47% as opposed to the 8% failure rate the first follower faced. Why is this so? The previously mentioned companies weren’t necessarily better than their predecessors. They used the data that was already available to them from the first movers and improved themselves. They had better business models, better management and better timing. They were more focused and learned from the mistakes previously made by others in the field. Also, by entering the market later, they could see that there existed market demand for their product.\n",
            "[Doc 607]: When it came out in the 1960’s, Star Trek tried to tackle issues of gender, race, socioeconomic differences and war. As it first aired during the Vietnam War, the peak of the Civil Rights movement, and the Cold War, the show tried – and often succeeded – in addressing these issues and educating its viewers for the better. Nichelle Nichols , who played Uhura in the series, was the first woman to have an interracial onscreen kiss on television. While protest quickly ensued, Nichols recalls being stopped one day on the street by a fan of the show who complimented the controversial kiss and encouraged her to keep taking chances. That fan was Martin Luther King .\n",
            "[Doc 1019]: Over the years, Paltrow has embraced a lot of quirky health fads and recommendations. She was heavily in favor of a macrobiotic diet, came out loudly as a raw foodist, and took a very long time to accept eating chicken. Likewise, Goop has marketed pseudo-scientific products and services like jade eggs, vaginal steaming and stickers that supposedly rebalance your energies. Some of the health trends that Paltrow has promoted are not backed by science and have turned out to be potentially damaging . The size of Paltrow’s following turns her endorsement of possibly harmful products into something potentially dangerous.\n",
            "[Doc 505]: A public statement reminds our short-term memories that misconduct is not just an isolated incident and invites the opportunity for reflection, for change. Once a public apology addresses the elephant in the room, action must be taken. When a public figure is in the spotlight of a scandal, everyone around them becomes involved in the conversation . For example, when allegations of sexual assault came out against Louis C.K., his close friend, Sarah Silverman , was among the first to comment. As the allegations were confirmed, more comics made statements fueling the conversation. Marc Maron, Jon Stewart and Bill Burr, were among friends and co-workers weighing in on the ugliness. A public apology fans the flame of interest and has the potential to spark further debate, which, ultimately, may bring awareness to sensitive issues like holding people accountable for their actions, which may further legitimize the victims’ feelings.\n",
            "[Doc 359]: Reagan is often credited with reviving the US economy, though his first term began with a 16-month recession. His true legacy, though, is one of expanding deficits caused by a growing defense budget and tax cuts that proved to be irresponsible. During Reagan’s presidency, there were also a record eight government shutdowns , suggesting enduring political partisanship and battles. When it came to responsible budgeting, Reagan was anything but a fiscal conservative. The budget deficit was just $79 billion Reagan’s first year in office, around 1.5 percent of GDP. By 1983, the shortfall had reached $208 billion , or 5.6 percent of GDP. It would reach $221 billion in 1986. The national debt nearly tripled to more than $2.6 billion when he left office. Had the US gone deeply into the red improving health care (these were the years of the AIDS crisis , which Reagan was infamously indifferent about) or fighting poverty , it may have been justifiable. But this was decidedly not the case.\n",
            "[Doc 317]: The U.S. Constitution aims to shape the American nation and give it character. It is the everlasting and timeless written spirit of the United States. Let’s look at the Founding Fathers, however questionable their personal lives and decisions were back then regarding racism. Did they think that racism should be included in the Constitution? It’s fairly evident that the answer is no. The First Amendment is not about speech, it is meant to ensure that those inhabiting America are safe and can express themselves as they see fit, which the Biden administration is advocating through its United We Stand Summit , which aims to work toward preventing and/or countering the effects of hate-fueled violence in society. American ethos is that of a melting pot; being multiracial is one of its core features. As such, all members of American society should be protected by the First Amendment – and safe from hate.\n",
            "[Doc 1959]: If the country is in trouble is the army the best placed to take over and manage the country better than it has been in the past? This may plausibly be true if the reason democracy is failing is a large scale insurgency or near civil war but in almost every other case it is not the best institution. The army is trained to fight not to govern. The generals who take over top positions are used to running a bureaucracy that has to respond to politicians, not one that has to respond to the people. Politicians may be corrupt, venal, or unpopular but at the least they are open about what they stand for. They have a manifesto and a clear ideology which if the people don't agree with they wont be voted for. This is not the case with generals; the chances are they have a bureaucratic desire to maintain the power and funding for the military but otherwise there is likely to be little known about their politics. Finally for those who are being overthrown the electorate has had a chance to investigate their policies, their past, to question their views and catch the candidate out when they are not consistent. The candidate came through an electoral test and media grilling. When there is a coup there is no such chance to determine if the coup leader is the right man for the job.\n",
            "[Doc 481]: Since more and more businesses have been moving online – even before especially after the coronavirus pandemic hit – it’s only logical that currency should do the same. Some people may be hesitant to adopt a technology that they don’t fully understand, but time is marching on regardless. When cloud technology first came around, many were put off by the idea, yet now it’s a given to use email, social media and online applications to store our memories and information. Similarly, people were initially skeptical of hospitality services like Airbnb, but it had 150 million users worldwide in 2023. Bearing in mind that the amount of available Bitcoin is limited, it may be beneficial to jump on the bandwagon instead of being left in the dust.\n",
            "[Doc 988]: A huge advantage that innovators have when coming out with their product is being the sole seller of the product. The time period until their ideas are copied and products are reproduced is key in building a lasting relationship with their customers. By being the only option on the market, consumers have no other options and must turn to the innovator himself or herself when purchasing. Research shows that the most critical time to gain consumer loyalty is when they make their first purchase or begin service. As it costs about 6-7 times more to acquire new customers than it does to keep current ones, it’s better to “strike while the iron is hot” and make sure you get those first customers on board.\n",

These weren’t the only impacts these bombs had. While the more-than-a-quarter-of-a-million death toll was enormous, the bombing itself was only the beginning of the enormous suffering the survivors went through.

A single-celled organism called *Chromosphaera perkinsii* appears to possess a embryonic process similar to animal mitosis, even though the organism separated from animal’s evolutionary line a billion years ago. * While this similar process suggests that animals inherited their own version of the ability from their single-celled ancestors, scientists can’t rule out the possibility that this could be another case of convergent evolution. However, scientists from Switzerland and the U.S. have discovered that this animal contained genetic instructions from embryonic development, meaning that the eggs existed even before life itself. “This paper gets at the core question of developmental biology, which is how we go from one cell to a whole animal, by looking at a related process in a weird, microbial relative to animals,” John Burns, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory in Maine said in a press statement.\n",

            "[68/185] Summarizing: Are Antidepressants a Good Solution?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 196]: Antidepressants are often only a temporary solution to depression and may not consistently be helpful in getting rid of it long-term. Studies show that the risk of relapse after discontinuing antidepressant medication is high; for one of the most common types of antidepressants (SSRIs), 26-45% of people relapse after discontinuing the medication, and the relapse rate is even higher for people taking stronger antidepressants.\n",
            "[Doc 67]: Antidepressants are a non-invasive way to “right the wrongs” that have transpired in a depressed person’s brain. Depression has been linked to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain, meaning that the chemicals which are responsible for happiness, eating, sleeping, and other important biological functions are off-kilter. Antidepressants are small pills taken orally that seek to restore this imbalance. While a chemical imbalance is not the only potential cause of depression, studies show that 60-70% of depressed patients who take antidepressants respond positively , with symptoms eventually remitting.\n",
            "[Doc 905]: Almost every drug poses a risk of negative side effects, but antidepressants up the stakes. Some antidepressants, such as benzodiazepines, have been found to be addictive and difficult to get off of. Fifty to 60% of antidepressant users experience significant side effects , such as gastrointestinal and sexual complications, weight gain, nausea, insomnia and/or diarrhea. Even worse is the possibility of suicidal thoughts , which is a potential side effect of almost every antidepressant. The last thing a person with depression needs is another incentive to self-harm, and these potential side effects are too dangerous to warrant giving antidepressants a try.\n",
            "[Doc 806]: People with Major Depressive Disorder often have a difficult time getting out of bed, let alone attending to their daily tasks. This kind of disorder needs immediate treatment, which antidepressants can’t provide. While antidepressants may be helpful in the long run, they don’t work fast enough. While it can take anywhere from six weeks to six months for antidepressants to take effect, newer generations of SSRIs take about three weeks – which is still way too long to wait for someone who’s feeling desperate and seeking professional help. Taking a pill for weeks without feeling a change may discourage a depressed person from continuing treatment or seeking further help. In contrast, seeing a therapist or implementing other lifestyle and behavioral changes into their daily routine may bring about quicker results.\n",
            "[Doc 2381]: Job guarantees for young people may place them in employment for some time at a low cost, but does not offer a permanent solution. The Swedish job guarantee scheme has been criticised for this reason . They will not create a solution based on skills, qualifications and economic growth because employers have little incentive to train up workers who are only temporary. If the company is not looking to expand there will be little point in wasting resources on someone they are not going to take on over the long term. Training has to be the solution to youth unemployment. The government should be training young people to fill the gaps that do exist in the market place such as care workers. When young people have skills that are in demand then they will be able to get full time employment without having to rely on temporary employment schemes to ‘make work’ for them to do.\n",
            "[Doc 1910]: When any life is removed so too is the future good that life may produce; all of the good that person would have experienced as well as all of the good they could have brought to other people’s lives will no longer occur. It is difficult to say precisely how much good a person may bring. However, it is fair to assume that saving five people brings with it a greater chance of higher levels of ‘good’. Considering the fact that one does not know anything about the people on the tracks one must assume that there will be five times more ‘good’ produced by saving their lives than if the one person is saved.\n",
            "[Doc 3085]: it is good if you help charity and donate so this is a good reason not to 'scrap the monarchy'\n",
            "[Doc 467]: For some, even the simple act of taking a pill can effect a positive change in mood, regardless of what the pill actually does. The placebo effect – which is when a person positively or negatively responds to fake treatment when they believe that the treatment is real – is a good demonstrator of this. In fact, a study of the placebo effect demonstrated that people with depression who show improvement while taking fake drugs get the most benefit when taking antidepressants. Just knowing that the pills are there provide comfort can be an encouragement to your brain to fight depression along with the medicine.\n",
            "[Doc 3668]: People have seemed to forgotten the basis of smoking; people start, and many continue to because they enjoy it. It relieves stress, can calm people and help them focus. It is also used as a hunger suppressant by models, and assorted other people. Smoking itself is a solution to other problems, if you think you could prevent all stress in society and remove any other reasons why people start smoking then i think you need to place your feet back on the ground. Smoking itself is a solution to other problems, not just a problem itself in the eyes of social facists. Can't really reference that other than personal experience (no im not an addicted chain smoker) and common sense.\n",
            "[Doc 4046]: Although not a permanent solution the re-introduction of prison ships could help ease conventional prison numbers and provide a stop gap for the prison system while it deals with the broader problem of overcrowding.\n",
            "[Doc 3138]: It should be for those kids who are the worst. But for the ones who are good and do thire work then no.\n",
            "[Doc 1216]: When depression is severe enough, finding a cure can become a crucial next step to save a person’s life. The pain of living with depression can often lead people to self-harm, and in some cases, to commit suicide. There tends to be a stigma against taking medication, which makes many weary of taking the plunge. However, antidepressants are one of the most effective treatments for mental illnesses, and should be a resource that is well-considered. As one therapist aptly says: “Depression without medication is like cleaning your house with a ball and chain on your ankle….When you take medication, you still have to clean the house, but without the ball and chain.”\n",
            "[Doc 3353]: Counterargument: Good-looking convicts are all physically fit.\n",
            "[Doc 2305]: As long as animals are treated as property, their interests will always be subsidiary to the interests of their owners. To treat animals as property simply because they are not human is specieism  and no different to discrimination on race or gender. So too must it be for animals. Making the treatment of animals more ‘humane’ is an inadequate solution because it does not change the fundamental problem of exploitation.\n",
            "[Doc 2003]: A regional court would be a good way to balance the competing issues between the legitimate concerns of the African states and the International Criminal Court. It would be able to provide an African solution to African problems, with no accusations of external interference or colonialism. Similarly, it would have some of the advantages of the ICC particularly its independence from individual states, meaning those in high places are more likely to be held to account. With this accountability to an African court there would be an impression of being held to account by peers not outsiders.\n",
            "[Doc 1936]: A ‘common good’ is a resource which has finite but replenishable supply but which is by its nature ‘non-excludable’ (meaning it’s hard to exclude individuals from using the resource). One example is the stock of fish in the sea. If all fishermen would refrain from overfishing, the fish population would have time to restore itself. But each individual fisherman has an incentive to capture and sell as much as possible. Since in a free market, there is no government coordinating supply and demand, each fisherman acts on their individual incentives. The result is rapid, irreversible depletion of the common good ( Tragedy of the commons,  1968). A ‘public good’ is a resource which is also ‘non-excludable’ but is also ‘non-rivalrous’, that is a good whose consumption by one consumer still allows simultaneous consumption by other consumers. One example of this is the air we breathe: every breath I take does not prevent you from taking a breath, nor can I feasibly exclude you from breathing. Other examples of public goods are schools, roads and national defense. Public goods suffer from the ‘free rider’ problem: once the good is produced, no one has an incentive to pay for the good. Since the good is non-excludable, no one can prevent someone from using it. This also leads to what economists call ‘negative externalities’: industries can freely pollute the air we breathe and not bear the costs for it. The issues of climate change are a direct example of this: corporations aren’t forced to pay for the negative externality of emitting greenhouse gases, and so continue doing it.\n",
            "[Doc 3126]: Through charging students more for their studies, the government will gain more money for themselves which as a result, they could use to inject into the economy at a time when, let's face it, the economy is in desperate need of a boost. As a long-term consequence of an increase in tuition fees this could be a solution to getting the country out of one of the worst recessions in a century and to keep it out of re-entering such a state.\n",
            "[Doc 2555]: The US Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General said on Jan. 7, 2013 that an investigation had found no evidence of widespread cheating on the DC Comprehensive Assessment System tests. It is likely that some cheating occurs, but some people cheat on their tax returns also, and the solution is not to abolish taxation.\n",
            "[Doc 2095]: Free trade essentially removes barriers for companies to do business across countries and regions. This leads to competition between countries in those regions, and between companies and industries in those countries. It leads to the sharing of innovation, drives down the cost of production, and allows workers to move freely where their labour and skills are needed. This is good for all those involved in the transaction. It is good for companies, because they have more resources and markets at their disposal, good for consumers, because competition between companies drives down prices and drives the innovation that improves products, and it is good for workers, because they have greater opportunities to find employment for their labour and skills .\n",
            "[Doc 1694]: Humans have large brains, form social groups, communicate and are generally worthy of moral consideration. We also are aware of ourselves and of the nature of death. Some animals have some of these characteristics but not all so should not have the same rights. In harming animals to benefit humans, we enter in to a good moral trade-off to create a greater good.\n",

The drugs that are most likely to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with SSRIs are other antidepressants, especially monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and the antibiotic linezolid. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were among the first drugs developed to treat depression. If your depression is resistant to other kinds of antidepressants (the drugs don’t work for you) or you have had side effects that you can’t tolerate, your doctor may recommend an atypical antidepressant. Their side effects are much the same as SSRIs, SNRIs, and CTAs. Because some of the atypical antidepressants increase serotonin, you should avoid other drugs that also increase serotonin because they can lead to serotonin syndrome. Some drugs that were first used to treat schizophrenia, called atypical antipsychotics, may also help certain kinds of depression, either alone or in combination with more traditional antidepressants.\n",

They estimated that slow tapering of antidepressants plus psychological support such as therapy could prevent one in five patients from relapsing, compared with going cold turkey, or tapering the dosage in under four weeks. Experts who were not involved in the study urged caution when interpreting the results, highlighting the proven effectiveness of antidepressants – and the real risk of relapse for people who have already had depressive episodes. “We know from long-term cohort data that roughly 60 to 70 per cent of people who have a first episode of depression will have a further episode over time, and good continuation trials suggest that maintenance antidepressants roughly halve that risk,” said Sameer Jauhar, a clinical associate professor in affective disorders and psychosis at Imperial College London.\n",

Experts are not sure exactly how antidepressants work, but historically they were thought to work by increasing levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and/or norepinephrine, in the brain. ## What are antidepressants used for? ## What are the differences between antidepressants? MAOIs block the effects of monoamine oxidase enzymes, and increases levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain. SSRIs increase levels of serotonin in the brain by preventing the reuptake of serotonin by nerves. SNRIs block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the nerve synapse. TCAs and TeCAs work by increasing levels of norepinephrine and serotonin. Increase levels of neurotransmitters by an unknown mechanism of action that is different from other pre-existing classes of antidepressant. ## Are antidepressants safe? ## What are the common side effects of antidepressants? ## Types of Antidepressants.\n",

Overall, the analysis found moderate-quality evidence that after successful treatment of depression, slow tapering of antidepressants combined with psychological support prevented relapse over the following year to a similar extent as remaining on an antidepressant at standard doses (either with or without psychological support). The researchers estimated that slow tapering of antidepressants plus psychological support could prevent one relapse in every five individuals compared with abrupt stopping or fast tapering (the two least effective strategies)—offering a clinically meaningful benefit. She added, \"These findings highlight the need for clinical guidelines to be updated to promote regular treatment reviews and individualized deprescribing with gradual tapering and structured psychological support for patients with depression who are feeling better and wish to come off their medication.\".\n",

            "[Doc 3872]: I do think that homework should have a limit because sometimes homework can be overwhelming and you spend a lot of time on the computer or with a sheet of paper doing homework instead of spending time with your family and doing things. You do need to do homework but there is a point where you just have to stop. You can't have piles and piles of homework isnt good but having some homework is good. Having no homework at all would leave you bored. Overal I think that having some homework is good but having a lot of homework isnt the greatest. So yes i think homework should have a limit.\n",
            "[Doc 2271]: Especially if we get too much homework it can take the enjoyment out of learning. No matter how engaging the teacher is in class homework will almost certainly be stressful, boring and tiring. It is simply much harder to make homework engaging and interesting as it is often done on our own. We know that there is no direct link between how much homework is set and grades. Studies done on this come to different conclusions so teachers should only set homework when they are sure it is needed. When we only get homework occasionally we will consider that piece more important and a better use of time.\n",
            "[Doc 807]: Homework assignments give parents a window into what their child is studying. Parental involvement has been shown to be significant for scholastic success. Therefore, homework assignments serve as a positive and productive way to bring parents and children together. Homework gives them an opportunity to be supportive about what their kids are learning. Plus, even if parents aren’t directly involved in a particular homework assignment, sitting next to their child and doing their own “homework,” in the form of paying bills, working or planning the week’s meals, can also serve as a model of support and quality bonding for the child. It also shows that doing homework is an early start to meeting lifelong responsibilities.\n",
            "[Doc 2269]: We all need some time to ourselves. School already takes up a lot of time and it is necessary to have time which does not involve concentrating on learning. Education is not the only important activity in everyone’s day; physical activity, play, and time with family are just as important as all teach life skills just in different ways. The internet makes it possible to be learning at home, there are even many computer games that help with learning. Homework clashes with these other activities. It can damage family relationships as it means parents have to try and make their children do their homework.\n",
            "[Doc 222]: A Duke University review of 25 years’ worth of studies on homework found a positive statistical correlation between homework and higher achievement, especially at the secondary-school level. An Oxford University study similarly demonstrated the connection between time spent on homework and results achieved. Just as one excels at an instrument or a sport through practice, so too is academic excellence achieved through practice. Veteran teachers defend homework as a vital part of skill improvement and student buy-in. Even students acknowledge the necessary role homework plays in their education, and many students report feeling more engaged in class after completing homework assignments.\n",
            "[Doc 268]: Elementary school students are just beginning their school careers. However, being burdened by homework , which stops them from doing fun activities, may make them feel negative emotions towards schoolwork. This negative attitude can then continue into the middle and high school years when homework becomes a more integral part of the education process. Many elementary students also feel that their homework is just “busy work” or that the teacher “has” to assign it, so they don’t take it seriously . Even worse is when homework is beyond a child’s ability and becomes work for the parents . This can lead to resentment in some parents who feel forced to complete their child’s projects – not to mention frustration on the part of the child, who feels he or she can’t do the homework without help.\n",
            "[Doc 532]: Way before the coronavirus hit, elementary school kids were already more stressed-out than any generation before them. While there are numerous causes for such stress, the burden of homework plays a large part. More than a decade ago a 2007 study by Metlife already reported that 28% of students in grades 3-6 were “often” or “very often” stressed out by homework and, since then, stress among children has only grown . More recently, more recently, 65% of parents said that homework-related stress negatively impacted their families. Homework stress may affect students’ health by causing headaches and stomach problems. Some children experience sleep deprivation by staying up too late to finish their homework. This is harmful to both kids’ health and their learning abilities, as sleep has been shown to help with memory consolidation . Plus, since parents usually have to remind elementary school students to do their homework, it often turns into a source of even more stress, thanks to the arguments that inevitably arise between parent and child.\n",
            "[Doc 2272]: The main aim of education is to prepare us for the rest of lives. Homework is teaching us a key skill that we will need in the future. When we do homework we are learning to work on our own, the discipline to get the work done without the teacher’s prompting, and when we come up against difficulties we learn how to overcome them without our teacher’s help. Millions of people work for themselves (self-employed), or work from home, they are using exactly the same skills doing homework teaches us. This is not a waste of time.\n",
            "[Doc 322]: Not all home environments are conducive to at-home learning. Level of education, time, and energy vary among parents, and parents at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum tend to have the least amount of each resource. Wealthier kids are more likely to benefit from homework simply because they have the necessary resources to complete it: adult assistance, home computers and internet access. However, students whose home situations may preclude them from completing homework (for example, older siblings who care for younger siblings or children who need to hold an after-school job) inevitably fall further behind . As such, homework can exacerbate achievement gaps between rich and poor students, rendering homework not only counterproductive, but a barrier to equality.\n",
            "[Doc 2270]: We are not the only ones who take a lot of time on homework, our teachers do as well. The teacher needs to design the homework, explain it, mark each piece individually, and tell everyone what they got right and wrong. If all this is not done then the homework loses its value as we need to be told individually what our mistakes are to be able to learn from homework. Teachers could as easily use the classwork to find out who knows what they are doing and who are making mistakes and it would save them time.\n",
            "[Doc 108]: Material is absorbed and remembered far better when it’s studied at spaced-out intervals , as per the Spaced Repetition learning theory. Students can process what they’re studying better when they return to it as homework after a few hours have passed, giving them a chance to learn at intervals. Homework also gives the child a chance to find out if they are confused by the topic so that they can seek assistance. Homework assignments also help the teacher to assess each individual child’s progress.\n",
            "[Doc 498]: A Brown University study supported what most parents have probably already observed in their homes – that homework is a flashpoint for family stress , affecting children and parents equally. Parents have a number of valid reasons to dread homework as much as their kids do – it forces their children to keep sitting after a long, mostly sedentary school-day; it cuts into family bonding time and diminishes opportunities for kids to take on other household duties. This is to say nothing of the pressure of guiding a child on homework that a parent may or may not understand. If homework is not welcome by parents or students, it can potentially damage the overall academic experience as well as a student’s home life as well.\n",
            "[Doc 566]: Beyond reinforcing lessons gleaned in the classroom, homework is often the first task that encourages young people to develop self-discipline, an indispensable skill for further learning and for life. Homework helps students learn to meet deadlines, to work independently and create their own study methods, and yes, how to approach assignments they might not be particularly interested in.\n",
            "[Doc 614]: When children reach high school, they’ll be expected to independently work on homework assignments, which are important for their final grades. Doing small amounts of homework from a young age therefore helps prepare students to meet their school responsibilities when they get older. It also instills self-discipline and trains them to meet deadlines in the real world when they’ll be expected to put in effort on their own. During coronavirus lockdowns, sheltering in place and remote learning, homework may have actually, ironically, provided kids with a reprieve from the boredom of quarantine .\n",
            "[Doc 3874]: Yes homework needs to have a limit because the children do have lives and don't do work all the time. They come home and they do chores for their parents. They go to parties and family affairs and maybe even host their own. Some might be in sport leagues and will be very busy and they might have clubs. So they might not have enough time to work on their homework. Also if they do, they will spend at least a little bit of it in enjoyment. I mean, everyone does this. Even the teachers who assign the homework. We all spend time enjoying ourselves once we come home after a long day of working. Therefore, the children might not have enough time to complete massive amounts of homework. Another point would be that, if the children have that much homework they will be extremely stressed with the stress of completing it and making sure it has good quality. This stress is definitely not good for their health, and in turn they might just give up. They just will go like i just can't do it and they won't do it. This would decrease their grades. if teachers give so much, they will get worse quality work and there would be less effort put in. So they might as well give less homework, so we will all do better and do our absolute best. All resulting in better quality work for in which both teacher and student will be happy about.\n",
            "[Doc 3873]: Homework till an extent is good. Keeps the child busy and interested in studies. But however an excess of homework definitely leads to over burden on the mind of the child. I believe that their should also be plethora of time time given to the child for his physical development. If much of homework is put on him\\er there's less time for him\\er to go out and play outdoor games. If the child after school is also busy with his homework, he finds less time for discovering himself , his capabilities and hobbies. Therefore I would like to end and say anything in excess is bad, everything should be balanced out in life for a better living.\n",
            "[Doc 2663]: Everyone knows that practice makes perfect. Students typically retain only 50% of the information teachers provide in class, and they need to apply that information in order to truly learn it. Homework helps students to develop key skills that they’ll use throughout their lives, such as accountability, autonomy, discipline, time management, self-direction, critical thinking, and independent problem-solving. A study of elementary school students who were taught \"strategies to organize and complete homework,\" such as prioritizing homework activities, collecting study materials, note-taking, and following directions, showed increased grades and positive comments on report cards. Research by the City University of New York noted that \"students who engage in self-regulatory processes while completing homework,\" such as goal-setting, time management, and remaining focused, \"are generally more motivated and are higher achievers than those who do not use these processes.\"\n",
            "[Doc 2300]: Homework is a vital and valuable part of education. There are only a few hours in each school day – not enough time to cover properly all the subjects children need to study. Setting homework extends study beyond school hours, allowing a wider and deeper education. It also makes the best use of teachers, who can spend lesson time teaching rather than just supervising individual work that could be done at home. Education is about pushing boundaries, and the learning should not stop at the entrance to the classroom – students should take skills learnt in the classroom and apply them at home. Homework allows this to happen, encouraging students to go above and beyond what they do in school. Reading is the best example, students learn how to read at school, but in order to get better, they need to practise and that is best done at home, with the support of parents and at the right pace for the student.\n",
            "[Doc 74]: The average American high-school classroom has an estimated 24 students . While teachers are trained to assess student learning on the spot, large class sizes can prevent teachers from checking each student’s progress in every session. When homework is treated as a formative assessment , an assignment given only as a starting point from which to deliver feedback, homework provides a crucial opportunity for teachers to fill in any gaps in their in-class assessments of student performance and identify where improvement is needed.\n",
            "[Doc 2664]: They are also more likely to have to work after school and on weekends, or look after younger siblings, leaving less time for homework. A study by the Hispanic Heritage Foundation found that 96.5% of students across the country said they needed to use the internet for class assignments outside of school, and nearly half reported there had been times they were unable to complete their homework due to lack of access to the internet or a computer, sometimes resulting in lower grades. Private tutoring is a more than $6 billion enterprise that further advantages students from wealthier families. A study published in the International Journal of Education and Social Science concluded that homework increases social inequality because it \"potentially serves as a mechanism to further advantage those students who already experience some privilege in the school system while further disadvantaging those who may already be in a marginalized position.\"\n",

            "[Doc 1200]: Studying abroad boosts cognitive creativity, self-confidence, communication skills and emotional intelligence . Engaging with different people who have varying mindsets is a great way to learn about new ideas and ways to think. Fully immersing oneself in such a different set of ideas allows people to identify with different backgrounds than their own. Traveling, studying and living abroad is likely to make you more open-minded and less prejudiced.\n",
            "[Doc 78]: According to an education advisory board survey , Americans studying abroad were more likely to drink in excess, use drugs and engage in other risky behavior. Environmental and peer influences are possible causes for increase in alcohol consumption. Lower drinking ages of the foreign country and increased independence have been found to correlate with elevated drinking. Additionally, being abroad with a higher incentive to make social bonds can encourage the use of alcohol with which to do so. Being in a foreign environment, with different cultural norms may cause students to neglect their studies in favor of partying.\n",
            "[Doc 907]: The period after high school presents the rare opportunity to go abroad for an extended period of time, because you are free from most commitments and obligations. While traveling alone may be too expensive to do for long, volunteering abroad can be a great way to learn new skills, meet people from other cultures, and simultaneously save on expenses. Help combat substance abuse in Ecuador or learn how to lead health campaigns in Nigeria’s underprivileged communities through the Peace Corps . Teach English in Japan, or volunteer to fight human trafficking in Cambodia. Volunteering abroad can help you discover your purpose and passions, which may unexpectedly shape your future career path.\n",
            "[Doc 519]: Moving to a foreign environment can be difficult to process. It can be highly depressing to live in a new country with no family and few friends. Over a third of American students abroad said that they had trouble functioning in the previous year due to depression according to one study . Leaving home to live abroad can take people out of their comfort zone in a way that is unexpectedly unsettling – especially during an uncertain pandemic era\n",
            "[Doc 3908]: For students who are not lucky enough to have their university fees paid for by parents, or for mature students who study part time, the needs of studying have be balanced against work place commitments. Therefore it may be the case that a person just does not have enough time to spend a couple of hours every night for a week to pursue studying, therefore a quick burst of revision is the only way in which they can possibly get round to passing exams.\n",
            "[Doc 374]: Learning a second language has been shown to benefit your brain not to mention job prospects , cognitive function as well as self-confidence and happiness. Living and studying abroad are the best ways to practice a new language on a spoken and written level. This allows one to understand the culture and people behind the language. The combination of a university-level language course and daily linguistic interaction in that foreign language’s culture can help students develop a solid grasp on a language.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 3910]: People can conduct as many studies as they want, but for revision it all comes down to what people feel most comfortable with, and if a student feels that last minute studying is likely to make them feel like they are revising better, then nobody can tell them that their technique is the wrong one.\n",
            "[Doc 904]: Bookstores may be filled with bestsellers that contain neat little lessons, but the lessons discovered by taking time to truly understand Great Literature are, perhaps, the richer ones. From studying literature, we learn about ourselves in greater perspective while learning to appreciate the many layers in art, and, indeed, life. There are supposedly only seven stories , or types of plots, in literature, and this is because the same things have always made humans tick. By deconstructing literature, we can place ourselves in these plots and identify a sense of purpose; we can challenge ourselves and our beliefs. Like great cuisine, Great Literature can’t be gulped down, it needs to be digested slowly .\n",
            "[Doc 3770]: Motivation is created by not having enough wealth, and wishing to get it by improving skills, using talents or studying hard. The prospect of inherited wealth destroys this motivation, so society gets less positive input and the recipients May not actualise their potential.\n",
            "[Doc 2096]: Free trade creates a \"race to the bottom\", whereby developing countries lower their labor and environmental standards in an effort to attract foreign investment. Developed countries, which may have higher standards, are then forced to lower them as well in order to make sure companies don’t relocate or outsource their jobs abroad .\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 3923]: Children need to get enough hours of daylight or they'll be depressed, it'll be too cold to be outdoors when they finish school and their sleep will be affected. During winter, school already takes up most of these hours and it mostly involves studying indoors.\n",
            "[Doc 1013]: Many volunteers raise money for their trips abroad, which usually cost a few thousand dollars due to travel expenses and the like. But this money is often used for the purpose of voluntourism , i.e., a trip focused on giving the volunteer an experience instead of fulfilling a need within a specific community. The money would be better spent by paying local workers do the jobs , as they may have the necessary skill sets themselves. Not to mention, it would provide locals with job opportunities. When volunteers use the money they raise towards their own trips (and opportunities to look good on social media), the community often ends up losing out.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 138]: A big part of college is fostering a network that will be able to assist you socially as well as career-wise after graduation. This network needs to be nurtured and maintained, which becomes almost impossible while living abroad. New connections made are unlikely to be of use to a student looking for a job back home.

            "[71/185] Summarizing: Should Women Serve in Combat Units?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 221]: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront? In Israel, women not only serve in combat units but lead them, too. India has also jumped on the equality bandwagon; its Supreme Court recently passed a ruling allowing women to serve as army commanders. The army mirrors society, and having exceptional women in the army is crucial to the way we want to see society. Any concern about having women in combat units stems from broader attitudes toward gender norms; these can’t begin to be addressed unless change starts at the core: The military.\n",
            "[Doc 161]: Many women in the military serve in support units like engineering, artillery, and medical support, and they make it to the battlefield just as much as those in combat units. For example, women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan were often on the front lines , even though they weren’t formally in combat roles. For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units.\n",
            "[Doc 452]: Until now, many militaries have been successful without having women in combat units. That’s not to say that women can’t contribute to their country; over 90% of U.S. military jobs are open to women, and they are just as instrumental to military success. However, commanders of co-ed combat units have added liabilities to worry about when women are added to the mix. Not to mention that complexities begin even with something as seemingly simple as uniforms and gear , which have different requirements to fit women than men and which are in short supply for women. So, why mess with the military status quo when it’s been working thus far?\n",
            "[Doc 18]: The stereotype that women are the more emotional gender is debunked in the military, where women hold their own . A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat.\n",
            "[Doc 9]: Adding women to combat units may invite potential sexual assault into the military. To many, it seems unrealistic to put men and women together in combat training environments, which can include confined spaces (like bunkers) with no privacy and expect no tension to arise between the sexes. This can lead to anything from distracting consensual relationships to sexual assault. Nearly one in four servicewomen have reported being sexually assaulted in the military, and military sexual trauma is the leading cause of post-traumatic stress disorder in female veterans. Adding women to combat units will only increase these instances .\n",
            "[Doc 632]: The Western world has made great strides when it comes to feminism , but gender equality shouldn’t be a factor when people’s lives are at risk. A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole. Female soldiers also have higher potential to be targeted for enemy attacks. Enemies don’t care about political correctness, and if letting women serve in combat units poses a threat to the safety of all soldiers, then providing equal opportunity to men and women must come second.\n",
            "[Doc 1422]: There is a fundamental principle that men and women should be considered equal in all walks of life; and as such should both have an equal role in the military, including being in combat. Not allowing combat roles for women has an unfortunate side effect of increasing inequality in terms of ranks. Combat duty is necessary or highly beneficial for promotion to senior officer positions in many armies. Women have to be given the same opportunities as men, in the army in order to have the same opportunities they have to be exposed to the same risks.

            "[Doc 1623]: How can it be assured the women entering African politics are representative of the women in that African nation? Further, will the leader implement politically popular ideas or required policies? If we are introducing quotas for women in politics we need to think about what women are entering. The concern with race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, and class is fundamental as if we accept the principle that an unrepresented group should get a quota of parliamentarians this should not just apply to women. We need to think about who the women are, what they represent, and who. Even for women simple quotas do not ensure effective representation of what all women want, or ensure the means for change. Women are heterogeneous, as are their challenges in life.\n",
            "[Doc 1622]: Including women in politics helps enable poverty to be tackled. Poverty is a women’s issue; women are more likely to live in poverty than men, and women are needed in politics to change this. Women understand each other, and what they need. Furthermore, although data varies, evidence shows gender inequalities remain intertwined to poverty and impoverishment . Women in positions of power and leadership can put the issues women face on the agenda and apply action. There is clearly a need to get women into politics to counter the current ‘boys club’ that exists in most countries where men help each other into positions of power squeezing out women and other methods of doing things.\n",
            "[Doc 3482]: Women are still portrayed in the media and marketing as sex objects, and many of them are willing participants. The hundreds of women bust their tails to make it big and their are still billboards of women close to naked on the side of the freeways. Completely indiscreet women flashing their boobs for the tele whenever possible and then these tactless videos are bought and sold on the open market. The women who are successful, as you say, are clearly out numbered. The women get on the television, ads, billboards, etc. and say 'this is my worth', 'this is what you should think of women'. These images are flashed in front of the children several times a day. They may learn of these successfull women one day and think that it is a mere fluke, and normal women are to be seen and treated like they are displayed in the media. Instead of \"what's on your mind?\" it's\"show me your boobs, Hottie mama! \", and crotch shots all around. These are the choices that women make to show the world that women are for sex, and not to be taken seriously.\n",
            "[Doc 1475]: One of the most important factors of oppression of women’s rights, particularly in the developing world, is dependence . Women are often confined to the home by force, lack of opportunity or social stigma, on behalf of their husbands. When she is not paid, a housewife must rely on her husband for money, especially if she has children she is expected to take care of. Economic empowerment allows further freedom for women in countries where women are confined to the home . By making women economic actors, you empower them to engage in different social structures and hold a stake and position in the centres of economic power. This is the most empowering tool one can offer women in most countries around the world . By paying housewives for their work, you offer one of the most powerful forms of social empowerment for women around the world. Women's Work and Economic Empowerment .

            "[Doc 1414]: Quotas attempting to maximise the number of educated and skilled women in executive positions could improve corporate performance and help raise national productivity. But doing so will depend on keeping ambitious, well-qualified women moving up the management ranks. Gender quotas will encourage more women to pursue education and career options leading to the top of executive positions. Quotas create incentives for women to adapt their job preferences to the more accessible boardroom positions and develop necessary skills which would reduce the need for positive discrimination in the future. Encouraged to develop relevant skills, women will contribute to the long-term talent pool and the economy. According to McKinsey report, women’s interest in being leaders increases as they progress from entry level to middle management  which is exactly what the principle behind quotas aims to encourage - more women following professional career development. This is very important in the short run during which, according to research, women who have high position stimulate other women’s interest in traditionally male-dominated sectors and encourage them to pursue similar career paths. \"Unlocking the Full Potential of Women in the US Economy.\"\n",
            "[Doc 119]: In Corinthians , Paul bids women to “keep silence in the churches…And if [women] will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.” Why must women minimize their presence at church? Why should she be forbidden to speak, to ask questions, and ultimately, to interact with new (and presumably transformative) spiritual concepts? The Bible paints women as a gender best seen but not heard.\n",
            "[Doc 4040]: In this modern day and age women are still discriminated against in the world of work. They still have lower pay and are less likely to get the promotion compared to their male counter part. To combat this, women need to come together and be cultured into an independent and strong environment for them to aspire for more. Girls in single sex schools will have more determination to succeed. Teachers can be instructedto teach in a way that drives the young women forward into life, giving them a sense of what could be achieved if they tried. The competition in the school will be for the best grades, not for the best looking boyfriend.\n",
            "[Doc 3213]: Most women never get off the sticky floor. I'm sure a great deal of the problem is caused by women taking excessive amounts of time off work to have children. Many of these are professional women, in whose families it is traditional to hire a nanny or to farm out children for their first few years, so why aren't they back at work as soon as they are fit? Their behaviour reflects badly on all other women, who are then tarred with the same brush. Employers should be required to employ equal numbers of men and women in all jobs at all grades under the same terms and conditions, working the same hours for the same pay and receiving the same training and chances of promotion. Women should also get the same pay, training and promotion as their male predecessors (many, in particular secretaries) are doing jobs once done only by men but for more pay and with better prospects. In short, employers should be required by law to treat women the same as men and that means not employing a married woman under her husband's name.\n",
            "[Doc 1371]: Sexist advertising harms women through objectification and diminishing of self-image. The United Nations Convention to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) links stereotypes about women to prejudice based on gender.1 Through visual and verbal messages women are portrayed as subservient to men. Women are seen increasingly as sex objects and these ads legitimize violence against women.2 Sexist advertising also harms women's self-image by portraying an ideal stylized body.3 The implied message is that consumers should seek to acquire these images even if they are contrary to the reality of body types and features. Eating disorders and obsessive beauty products consumption results in order to attain ideal beauty images presented in the media.4 Sexist ads also harm men through stereotyped images of masculinity.5 \n",

            "[Doc 1406]: Pornography presents a distorted perception of people, sexuality, and relationships, which has a further effect on a broader societal level. It promotes unreachable ideals of how both women and men should be in bed, and pushes both in the direction of what is idealised in pornography. This may push men to be more dominating than otherwise and women to suffer from anorexia, low self-esteem, and promiscuity. We can expect women to be the most affected by this, simply because the porn industry is owned almost entirely by men, and because there are pre-existing patriarchal structures in society ready to promote the idea that women are there to serve men. Altogether, pornography merely promotes a new stereotype: that women are generally happy to have sex at any time, that they will respond positively to any man’s advances, and if a woman does not, there is something wrong with her.\n",
            "[Doc 592]: Ninety-four percent of Botox treatments are administered to women. This data by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reflects a deep imbalance in societal expectations upon aging women to appear young. Over the years, Hollywood has gone from criticizing to accepting those who get Botox without addressing the product’s primary assumption – that it is important for women to be young-looking. It is this assumption that entangles women in unrealistic standards that can often form into an unhealthy preoccupation with the body. Doctors and patients alike report the addictive nature of Botox treatments. Patients show up younger and younger for injections, complain more frequently about wrinkles, and, unsatisfied with their results, are more likely to seek more aggressive remedies to combat aging, including surgery. Aging women are not the only victims. Over one-third of girls report dissatisfaction with their bodies from age five. Many social science experts have located the uptick in depression, eating disorders, and self-harm in society’s obsession with aesthetic perfection – of which Botox may only serve as a quick, temporary fix.\n",
            "[Doc 1021]: In 2008 and 2012, Obama won more female votes than any of his predecessors. Through the (now defunct) White House Council on Women and Girls and increased enforceability of laws designed to combat pay discrimination, Obama’s administration directed efforts to ensure that American women could achieve financial independence. Higher minimum wages meant mothers could spend more time with their children; paid family leave would allow parents to parent without curbing their careers and ultimately, their spending power. Linking gender equality to America’s economic prosperity helped Obama to co-opt bipartisan support for a number of women’s issues. Despite Obama’s leaving office, women’s issues have had tremendous staying power; his legacy gave rise to powerful movements like #MeToo and Time’s Up, which continue to strongly advocate for women.\n",

            "[Doc 1189]: Companies that offer paid maternity leave found that it’s good for their business. Women who can take paid maternity leave are more productive, working a reported 15 to 20% more hours during their baby’s second year than women who didn’t take leave. Paid maternity leave also increases retention rates among companies. Women who can take paid maternity leave are more likely to return to their job at the end of their leave period. The cost of paying an additional ten weeks (or whatever the agreed-upon time period is) of salary is far less than the overall cost of finding, hiring and training new staff to replace women who abandon their job after giving birth.\n",
            "[Doc 468]: Paid maternity leave sounds good for women, but it can actually harm their job prospects. Businesses may not like to admit it, but they would be less likely to hire women of child-bearing age just to avoid facing the extra cost of paying their maternity leave. People argue that discrimination laws would prevent this from happening, but it’s often almost impossible to prove why a company hired one person rather than another. Alternatively, all women would end up being paid a lower wage to balance out the expected cost of maternity leave. Paid maternity leave would be especially unfair on women who don’t have children, who would be paid a lower wage without even getting the benefit of taking leave.\n",
            "[Doc 1078]: Many people who are opposed to paid maternity leave argue that it will cause an unfair hike in payroll taxes to cover the extra government payouts. But consider the welfare costs of not taking maternity leave. Many parents can’t afford to live on one income, even for just a few weeks. They slip into credit card debt and might be forced to turn to food stamps and other welfare payments. A report from the United States Department of Labor discovered that approximately 15% of people who took unpaid or partly-paid leave turned to welfare payments. A Rutgers University study in New Jersey, where there is state-mandated paid maternity leave, found that women who took paid leave were 40% less likely to take public assistance or food stamps than women who didn’t take leave.\n",
            "[Doc 1500]: Employers worry when they hire young/middle aged women. They fear that after hiring a woman, she will only cost the company money by getting pregnant and going on maternity leave. To combat this attitude, maternity and paternity leave should be equal. Currently, paternity leave is a maximum of two consecutive weeks. These two weeks must be taken within 56 days of the child’s birth. This can be contrasted with the long maternity leave that is allowed for. Women are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave from day one of employment. Women are entitled to maternity pay for 39 weeks if they have been working for their employer for 26 weeks. Father’s also do not have the right to take time off work to attend antenatal classes, this allowance is for pregnant employees only. The feminist cause still has this issue to resolve. Until paternity leave is offered an employer can safely assume that a woman will be the partner to burden the care of the child and the employer will be the one to bear these costs of maternity leave. This gives men an unfair advantage in the workplace as they are a “safer bet” for employment.\n",

A small business with only a few workers can’t afford to keep on paying someone who isn’t working for months. It would be too expensive for the business to hire a temp to cover the new mother’s work; then they’d have to pay two salaries for the same amount of work. Government-mandated paid maternity leave could severely harm the chances of small businesses to flourish, which has a knock-on effect on every area of the economy.\n",
            "[Doc 812]: Paid maternity leave can reinforce stereotyped gender roles in a way that’s harmful to both women and men.

It reinforces the expectation that men aren’t interested in spending time with their children. Today, many men want to be hands-on fathers and look forward to spending time caring for their infants and small children. However, without paid paternal leave, they barely get a chance to see their babies on a working day. More and more research has come to light that shows long-term benefits of paternity leave for fathers, children and families. So, in addition to them missing out on bonding with their babies, as the wage gap increases because of maternity leave, fathers will only have to work harder to make up for their partner’s drop in pay.\n",
            "[Doc 324]: Having a baby is a rigorous experience that takes its toll on women’s physical and mental health. Paid maternity leave would allow these women the time needed to heal, or at least start healing. However, many women who have to return to work just a few days or weeks after giving birth have to lift heavy items and/or stand for long periods of time, even though this could be dangerous for their ongoing health. Even the increasing numbers of women who give birth by C-section often need to return to work before the recommended period of convalescence. Paid maternity leave has been found to lower the risks of post-partum depression. Being forced back to work by fear of losing their jobs or the financial pressure of living on one paycheck can seriously impact women’s health for years after giving birth. Not to mention, every extra month of maternity leave can be linked to a 13% reduction in the infant mortality rate. Society’s values of loyalty and responsible parenting should urge employers to stand by those who risk their physical and mental health to give birth to and nurture children , who are America’s future.\n",
            "[Doc 767]: A main factor that prevents mothers from breastfeeding is the need to quickly return to work, sometimes in jobs that make no accommodation for lactating mothers. Increasing the number of women who breastfeed ups the urgency to set policy on matters like paid maternity leave, the availability of lactation rooms, time to pump as well as access to services that support breastfeeding. If the workforce would accommodate breastfeeding mothers and their needs, maybe more new mothers would be willing to choose the breastfeeding route instead of feeling like once they returned from maternity leave, they would be punished or burdened because of it.\n",

On the other end of the spectrum, students from families that can financially support them for a while would be advised to put off finding employment in order to look for a better paid job. Taking any job only works for those actually in financial trouble. People being paid wages aren't self-sufficient, they're just dependent on an employer rather than the Government.

Poor infrastructure has real consequences – lack of maintenance leads to increased accidents (and deaths, as with the Baltimore bridge collapse ) and inefficiency that cost billions of dollars. Health care is another weak point for America. True, America is not the only country that was caught unprepared for the pandemic. However, perhaps its current health care system, with high costs and low medical capacity, contributed to the country’s vulnerability. America has long needed to invest in improving its health care system so that it can better promote health and equality, especially compared to other countries.\n",

For instance, the Candoshi of Peru, like a handful of other societies, don’t have a word for the over-arching concept of “color.” Some researchers argue that the Candoshi also don’t have specific color words, but rather describe things more holistically. In one study, if the Candoshi were shown a red chip on a ceramic surface, they usually described it with a word that means “like ripe fruit.” But if the same chip was on the floor, people more often deemed it to be “like blood.” Perhaps these words aren’t really color terms at all. Likewise, a linguist has argued that the Warlpiri people of Australia have no color talk . Many argue that people in pre-manufacturing societies simply don’t find color so important; while different colors might be the only thing that distinguishes one shirt from another, that rarely if ever happens in the natural world.\n",

With these three cones, most people can distinguish millions of distinct shades. There are a few exceptions, of course. There are a variety of types of color blindness, usually affecting men, where one or more of these cones is missing or mutated, often making it hard to tell green from red.

            "[Doc 1368]: The experience of reading from a newspaper is a far better user experience than reading from a screen, reading from a screen for long periods of time is not only bad for the eyes but quite often becomes uncomfortable. A newspaper however requires natural light to be read and therefore is not as harsh on the eyes. It could also be suggested that people actually prefer the tactile physical experience of a newspaper or book over holding an electronic device, a poll taken on the Guardian 1 website found that 76.1% preferred books, i.e, a physical experience, over a digital one. Video and audio-based advertisements placed online around the text can also disrupt the reading process, a problem, which does not afflict newspapers.\n",

However, human cloning is a completely artificial form of reproduction, which leaves no trace of the dignity of human procreation.\n",
            "[Doc 368]: Even before they can talk, babies seem to think there’s more of a difference between what we call green and blue, than between two different types of blue. This is the case even if these colors are all the same “distance” away from each other on a color chart. A study of 4-month-olds showed that they were quicker to notice a green circle against a blue background than a different-blue circle against that same blue background. The work has been repeated in 8-month-olds . This hints that color categorization might be hard-wired into the brain.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 3851]: if its called animal testing and we are animals then you can test on us\n",
            "[Doc 1695]: The real benefit of animal testing is making totally new drugs, which is about a quarter of them. After non-animal and then animal tests, it will be tested on humans. The reason why the risk is low (but not non-existent) for these brave volunteers, is because of the animal tests. These new chemicals are the ones most likely to produce improvements to people’s lives, because they are new. You couldn’t do research on these new drugs without either animal testing or putting humans at a much higher risk.\n",
            "[Doc 111]: Covid-19 is still fresh in everyone’s minds, as is the relief the world felt once the vaccine was distributed (at record speed), thanks to animal research . Polio , one of humanity’s oldest and most pernicious killers, was also eradicated with the help of animal testing, as were smallpox and rubella. Plus, diabetes can now be controlled through insulin, which was discovered with the contribution of animal testing. Add to that new developments in HIV, cancer, and diabetes treatments, and even electronic implants that can give patients the chance to activate paralyzed limbs, and it becomes clear that human medicine without animal subjects would be a mere shadow of itself. Animal research is the primary vehicle for understanding how disease affects the human body. When we say no to animal testing, we also say no to deeper understanding and possibility.\n",
            "[Doc 1692]: We don’t know how we will be able to develop new drugs without animal testing until we end it. We now know how most chemicals work, and computer simulations of chemicals are very good. Even skin left over from surgery can be experiment on, and being human, is more useful. The fact that animal research was needed in the past isn’t a good excuse any more. We still have all the advancements from animal testing in the past, but it’s no longer needed.\n",
            "[Doc 2551]: The US Department of Education stated: \"Although testing may be stressful for some students, testing is a normal and expected way of assessing what students have learned.\" A Nov. 2001 University of Arkansas study found that \"the vast majority of students do not exhibit stress and have positive attitudes towards standardized testing programs.\" Young students vomit at their desks for a variety of reasons, but only in rare cases is this the result of testing anxiety.\n",
            "[Doc 1099]: Animals and humans are often afflicted by the same infectious and congenital diseases. Almost all of our pets die from diseases that are well known to us – the most common cause of sudden death in cats is heart disease, the same disease that kills the most women in the US every year. Medicines developed via animal testing for human use often end up benefitting the very animal populations upon which they were first tested. (For example, monkeys, Ebola’s first victims, could benefit from a developmental Ebola vaccination). The reflexive nature of advances and human sciences is expressed in the One Health initiative , whose central premise connects human health to the health of animals as well as the environment. As such, animal testing is not merely a subjugation of animal life to human life, but a necessary step in preserving Earth’s biology writ large.\n",
            "[Doc 3843]: Alternatives to animal testing do exist and scientists already use them. In fact, they are mandated to do so by law wherever possible. Such alternatives exist in the form of computer modeling and in vitro testing (testing on a cell culture). However, living organisms are incredibly complex systems. The only possible way to build a model that accurately represents them is through animal research. It is currently not possible to build a complete human model as it is simply too sophisticated for current computers. For example, no computer model could predict the effect of a electrode insertion therapy for Parkinson's disease on the human brain, which is capable of performing 100'000'000'000'000'000 operations per second. Yet this can be done using an animal model. Computer models are currently at the stage of predicting molecular interactions, however they are still a great way to go before they could accurately model even the most basic of organisms, let alone the incredibly complex human body. Furthermore, it would be in the pharmaceutical companies' interests to do use alternatives wherever possible - imagine the cost to housing, maintaining and testing on animals.\n",
            "[Doc 3060]: Humans are very self-centered in the fact that until a problem arises before our eyes we are unthinking and unconcerned. It is for this reason that animal privacy is neglected. We can never interpret whether an animal is private or not. We will assume instead that the animal is scared as this is what we know of animals. However, by broadcasting documentaries based upon animals we are raising human awareness of them. This brings issues into the public eye and this in turn means that humans have more regard for animal welfare. This can help us, and has, protected endangered animals. As a result of these documentaries: People protest against animal hunters and fishermen who spoil a whale’s dinner. This is how documentaries can ascertain a benefit to the animal themselves.\n",
            "[Doc 2509]: When testing medicines for potential toxicity, the lives of human volunteers should not be put in danger unnecessarily. It would be unethical to perform invasive experimental procedures on human beings before the methods have been tested on animals, and some experiments involve genetic manipulation that would be unacceptable to impose on human subjects before animal testing. The World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki states that human trials should be preceded by tests on animals.\n",
            "[Doc 1329]: Undoubtedly then, the most beneficial research to mankind is the development of truly novel drugs. Even according to the proposition this represents about a quarter of all new drugs released, which could be seen as significant given the great potential to relieve the suffering beyond our current capacity that such drugs promise. After the effects, side effects and more complex interactions of a drug have been confirmed using animal and non-animal testing, it will usually pass to what is called a phase I clinical trial - tests on human volunteers to confirm how the drug will interact with human physiology and what dosages it should be administered in. The risk of a human volunteer involved in a phase I trial being harmed is extremely small, but only because animal tests, along with non-animal screening methods are a highly effective way of ensuring that dangerous novel drugs are not administered to humans. In the United Kingdom, over the past twenty years or more, there have been no human deaths as a result of phase I clinical trials. Novel compounds (as opposed to so-called \"me-too\" drugs, that make slight changes to an existing treatment) are the substances that hold the most promise for improving human lives and treating previously incurable conditions. However, their novelty is also the reason why it is difficult for scientists to predict whether they may cause harm to humans. Research into novel compounds would not be possible without either animal testing, or tremendous risk to human subjects, with inevitable suffering and death on the part of the trial volunteers on some occasions. It is difficult to believe that in such circumstances anyone would volunteer, and that even if they did, pharmaceutical companies would be willing to risk the potential legal consequences of administering a substance to them they knew relatively little about. In short, development of novel drugs requires animal experimentation, and would be impossible under the proposition's policy.\n",
            "[Doc 2557]: Prominent testing critic Diane Ravitch, Research Professor of Education at New York University, concedes standardized testing has value: \"Testing... is not the problem... information derived from tests can be extremely valuable, if the tests are valid and reliable.\" She cites the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) as a positive example, and says tests can \"inform educational leaders and policy-makers about the progress of the education system as a whole.\"\n",
            "[Doc 3847]: There are constant accusations made by animal rights activists that animal research provides inaccurate results. These accusers make no effort to suggest an alternate method of study that would be more effective. The truth is that it is the most effective and safe way of testing available currently. A more appropriate argument would be the usual, that it is unethical but debating that it is not the best way to solidify results that is readily available at this time is a fruitless argument.\n",
            "[Doc 3845]: Medical testing on animals saves human beings, it allows us to advance as a species. How else can we test new drugs? almost every drug we used has been tested on animals scientists save a bunch of people and only hurt one animal, and most times its not severe at all. If people want to step up and participate in an experiment fine by me id happily find the best treatment for cancer on a human or a mouse so long as its found. Scientists hopes aren't to make the animal uncomfortable or hurt. Its to help millions of more animals and humans.\n",
            "[Doc 2302]: Slaughter without stunning is painful for the animal. All slaughter methods which do not involve stunning work by bleeding the animal so that it suffers brain-death. This is normally done by cutting the neck. Depending on the species of animal, it can survive for anything between 20 seconds and 2 minutes after this. Although animals can’t tell us if they are in pain, the best metrics we have – brain activity, eye movement and making sounds – indicate that the animals are in pain during this period. When we have two methods of killing the animal available, it is inhumane to use the more painful one. It follows that we should require stunning.\n",
            "[Doc 215]: Improved imaging methods, in vitro , and computer models represent some of the many emerging options for conducting research without animals. Governments, scientists, and even the commercial science industry agree that alternative approaches are preferable, especially given that when a test is repeated on an animal, scientists get the same outcome only 60-70% of the time. For commercial science enterprises, non-animal experiments have the dual benefit of cost efficiencies and less regulation. It stands to reason that the more the public nudges researchers toward alternative testing measures, the more encouraged they’ll be to find them.\n",
            "[Doc 918]: The FDA requires all chemical materials, like cleaning products and cosmetics, to be tested on animals before introducing them to humans. The only trouble is, many toxicity tests performed on animals do not always predict severe human toxicity, which is bad news for millions of mice, and for some humans too. A lack of correlation between animal and human reactions has also been reported in clinical trials, some of which have caused human subjects to suffer permanent physiological damage . If animal testing cannot give full guarantees of safety or results, is it really meeting its ends?\n",
            "[Doc 3848]: Only unsympathetic people towards animals would think this!! What if you were the one with drops of neat shampoo being put into your eyes, unable to blink to wash it out? How would you like to have a cigarette put in your mouth and not be able to remove it because your hands were tied? The list goes on, and so does the pain for animals!! As for saying that it helps research, crap!! an animals body and make-up is not the same as a human...so why would you need to experiment on them? I say, anyone that thinks that, should be locked in a room with the animals they have tested on!! But these people have no conscience and don't care about causing suffering. Just like slave traders or concentration camp guards had no care for the humans they tortured. To be fair researchers aren't inhumane, evil and intentionally cruel people. They have worked and studied for years believing that animal testing is the best way forward. By the time they have graduated, it is so hard-wired into their way of thinking that it is next to impossible to convince them otherwise. Generally, they try hard to make conditions better for the animals they test on but often aren't allowed to change conditions too much for fear of skewing the results. Government regulations also state that animal testing is obligatory before any tests can be carried out on human beings. It's sad but true. Don't blame the researchers too much - they're just doing what they have been convinced is the best thing to do.\n",
            "[Doc 3684]: It is obvious that there need to be big changes in how we fight HIV/AIDS. Compulsory (presumably universal) testing is one thing that needs to be done if we are to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is however possible that the labeling will not be necessary if there is universal testing. Having both them and others know that they are infected is part of this.\n",
            "[Doc 1326]: As experimenting on animals is immoral we should stop using animals for experiments. But apart from it being morally wrong practically we will never know how much we will be able to advance without animal experimentation if we never stop experimenting on animals. Animal research has been the historical gold standard, and in the case of some chemical screening tests, was for many years, by many western states, required by law before a compound could be released on sale. Science and technology has moved faster than research protocols however, and so there is no longer a need for animals to be experimented on. We now know the chemical properties of most substances, and powerful computers allow us to predict the outcome of chemical interactions. Experimenting on live tissue culture also allows us to gain insight as to how living cells react when exposed to different substances, with no animals required. Even human skin leftover from operations provides an effective medium for experimentation, and being human, provides a more reliable guide to the likely impact on a human subject. The previous necessity of the use of animals is no longer a good excuse for continued use of animals for research. We would still retain all the benefits that previous animal research has brought us but should not engage in any more. Thus modern research has no excuse for using animals. Alternatives: Testing Without Torture.\n",
            "[Doc 2510]: In addition to local and state laws and guidelines, animal research has been regulated by the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) since 1966. As well as stipulating minimum housing standards for research animals (enclosure size, temperature, access to clean food and water, and others), the AWA also requires regular inspections by veterinarians.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1215]: Let’s take a closer look at why obesity should be identified as a disease: It is positively correlated with diseases that are highly expensive to treat, like kidney disease . Dialysis, a common treatment for kidney failure, costs an average of $72,000 per year, per patient. With nearly 500,000 individuals on dialysis in the US, it constitutes a significant cost burden for individuals, insurance companies, and the government. Sources estimate that obesity costs the US health system $173 billion a year . By defining obesity as a disease, cost-effective treatments for obesity – like consultations with a nutritionist, physical therapy, or even bariatric surgery – can help to circumvent cases (and therefore costs) of the diseases with which obesity is associated. As the old adage goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As such, in the works are federal, evidenced-based dietary guidelines for infants, pregnant women and young children in an effort to prevent obesity.\n",
            "[Doc 3903]: Obesity levels need to drop if a nation is to improve it's health. A tax deterrant would motivate people to make wiser food choices and not overeat. It would raise public awareness of the significance of the problem of obesity.\n",
            "[Doc 1202]: Yale disease prevention researcher, D.L. Katz , points out that in terming something a disease, one would expect remedies to lie within the realm of pharmacological treatment, clinical visits, or surgery. Therefore, classing obesity as a disease may inadvertently steer treatment toward drugs and gastrointestinal surgeries, for a condition that can often be overcome (albeit less easily) through diet and exercise. Worse, it may diminish an obese person’s sense of control over their weight, and effectively discourage behavioral changes that contribute to weight loss.\n",
            "[Doc 989]: While being overweight or obese can have a number of negative effects on overall health and quality of life, it is hardly a focus of medicine. Medical schools tend to focus on pathology, devoting little time to matters of nutrition and activity’s impact on health. This leaves physicians ill-equipped to advise their patients on such matters. As such, terming obesity a disease stands to restructure physicians’ values and learning on the topic. Designating obesity as a disease rather than a consequence of poor lifestyle may relieve the stigma surrounding it and encourage those affected to seek medical assistance, instead of avoiding appointments for fear of humiliation. It may provide doctors the opportunity to address such matters diplomatically and accurately, like by prescribing the diabetes drug Ozempic to induce weight loss, instead of equating obesity with lifestyle behavior, thereby leaving patients feeling fat-shamed , which has been found to promote weight gain , or wanting to avoid the issue altogether.\n",
            "[Doc 565]: People of all shapes and sizes fall ill for reasons that have nothing to do with weight, and many people are in prime physical health despite being obese. The development of diseases like cardiovascular disease , stroke, and cancer depends on a great many factors beyond weight. A full third of people deemed obese indicate no increased risk for diabetes or heart disease. Interestingly, while obesity is a risk factor in some diseases, it provides a safeguard against others. For example, obese women are less likely to develop osteoporosis , and another study showed that people deemed overweight by BMI measurements actually outlived their counterparts in the normal BMI range.\n",
            "[Doc 973]: While scientists today don’t have a consensus on what causes obesity, many think it is often caused by a number of underlying genetic or metabolic factors that cause people to gain weight or make them unable to lose weight. Genes control everything from a person’s ability to metabolize food to how full one feels after a meal. In some individuals, genetic factors can influence obesity by as much as 80%. Those who have a greater genetic disposition toward obesity are not usually able to lose weight or maintain weight loss through diet and exercise alone. Studies have shown that for long-term success, chronically obese patients indeed require intervention beyond incorporating a healthy diet and exercise into one’s lifestyle. Bariatric and other forms of gastric surgeries show the most salient results for long-term weight management.\n",
            "[Doc 3800]: Terminally ill patients, or those in a permanent vegetative state, can take up valuable hospital beds for those who do want to get better. If they do not want to live, then they should not be allowed to take the beds and care of those that do. Long term palliative care for the terminally ill is a huge and ultimately wasteful drain on medical resources. Why waste these precious resources on someone who has expressed a desire to die, when they could be improving the life of someone who wants to live? In addition, these resources could be re-allocated to further the research of the specific disease the patient is suffering in order to allow future generations to either not have the disease or increase the quality level of care for future patients of this disease by alleviating the symptoms of the disease at the very least. In addition, if the patient is an organ donator and the organs are healthy, it may save up several lives which are ultimately invaluable. working in the care system with people with dementia i have to say in many cases its cruel to keep them alive, we are kinder to our pets when so ill. This is an awful disease which takes any quality of life away, One lady i know has been bed ridden for 5 years unable to communicate , move her limbs or anything if the nazis had done this to people it would be a war crime. This is not about god or any other belief its about common sense.

            "[Doc 4058]: Deregulation is like trying to play a game of football without a referee. Government can't demand that people take responsibility for things that they have no control over, especially when ordinary citizens are against big business that has huge amounts of money to spend lobbying in it's interest (making money and nothing else) while people are left without a defence against the negative effects of deregulation. Obesity isn't entirely the responsibility of a particular person, it should be treated as a disease like any other. This is not to dismiss personal responsibility altogether, but to highlight a reality: that the forces that drive obesity are, for many people, overwhelming.” [[Government Office for Science, 2007. Tackling Obesities: Future Choices. Project Report, 2nd Edition. Telling people that they should have to take into account every possible consequence of their actions is both unfair on them and unneccessary. Where an action has consequent effects on other people (such as carbon emissions causing global warming) that an individual can't neccessarily foresee or take into account, we need the Government to step in and regulate to avoid those external harms.\n",
            "[Doc 2492]: Obesity can be caused by hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, arthritis, increased insulin levels (from carbohydrate-heavy diets or diabetes treatments) and depression. Certain drugs like antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, anti-psychotic medications, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, steroids, beta blockers, and contraceptives can cause obesity. Obesity can also be caused by lack of sleep (or sleep debt), ingesting endocrine disrupters (such as BPA, DDT, and phthalates), consuming high-fructose corn syrup, a lack of temperature variation (due to air conditioners and heaters), and quitting smoking.\n",
            "[Doc 910]: The pain and loss of functionality caused by terminal diseases can be truly insufferable. It is a fact that not all pain can be effectively managed . If a central goal of medicine is to alleviate suffering, then insisting that terminal patients languish in irremediable pain will always be counterproductive to this goal. Pain is not the only devastating consequence of terminal disease. The loss of function that accompanies diseases like ALS compromises independence – patients lose the ability to feed themselves, relieve themselves, speak, and more. If a disease has the power to rob an individual of his or her personhood, death may be more humane than seeing such a disease through to its end.\n",
            "[Doc 3217]: Nowadays there are so many warnings about the dangers of obesity that if a parent ignores these warnings it is out of choice. If a parent ignores any danger that could affect their child’s health then they are guilty of neglect and should be prosecutable offence. From experience, I can say that the problem is not as much ignoring the warnings as it is a failure to control the child. Parents are not so ignorant of the medical maladies because they do see and hear the warnings. But many parents are unable to deny their children. They see the obesity as less threatening than the possibility of losing the \"affection\" of the child. Parents typically do not want to be the \"bad guy\" who must enforce the rules of positive values and will, in more cases than not, allow the child to maintain a poor diet and eat too often. I am the stepfather of a mildly autistic male who is now 20 years old and roughly 380 lbs. I've seen this played out in person and I can confidently state that, until this allowance of bad vaules is changed, this problem will run even more rampantly. If parents are unwilling or simply unable to make the necessary changes then, perhaps it is time for the legal system to step in...they would if the child were being physically abused. I maintain that the outright allowance of obesity and its many maladies IS physical abuse and should be dealt with appropriately.\n",
            "[Doc 3309]: Obesity is the cause of many diseases and cancers. Heart attacks and colon cancer are two of the most reported. These are long standing diseases which take a variety of drugs to cure or at least alleviate the symptoms. These drugs are expensive, and many people who have not caused their own disease miss out on new drugs as the NHS is not willing to pay the extra money for the drugs. If healthy eating were mandatory, then less money would be needed by the NHS to heal people who have eaten themselves to oblivion and more money can be spent on newer drugs.\n",
            "[Doc 805]: Among OECD countries, America is the most obese. With a rise in obesity comes growing obesity discrimination , which pushes the idea that being overweight is a sign of laziness, poor hygiene and lack of self-care. Studies have also found that most Americans link being overweight with these undesirable stereotypes, and that employers view obese people undesirable job candidates. However, by inspiring people to focus on health over beauty standards, BoPo uses language that strips away stereotypes, creating a more accepting and inclusive society. It separates weight from health, body image from self-worth. The movement recognizes the stigma around different body types as weighing us down as a society and tries to alter it for the better.\n",
            "[Doc 3310]: Those who want to eat healthily are, those who cannot be bothered are not going to pay attention to a colourful ad campaign. There has been so much coverage on obesity now that anyone who has not changed their lifestyle is unlikely to do so unless it is made mandatory.\n",

            "[Doc 550]: The government uses its budget to provide for its citizens, and a soda tax seems to be a good way to grow the budget. Harvard researchers suggest that the tax could assist 36,000 people per year in avoiding obesity, prevent 2,280 diabetes cases annually, prevent 730 deaths over ten years, and save nearly $200 million in health spending. It’s a win-win for Americans: they’ll either stop drinking unhealthy beverages or they’ll contribute to the country. Tax payers’ dollars could officially go towards paying back the national deficit. Alternatively, these tax dollars could go towards Medicaid and healthcare subsidies, serving the nation’s citizens over the long term. This budget increase could see the implication of better school lunch services, community playgrounds and health education classes to counter obesity.\n",
            "[Doc 1513]: Having a child is a process of wonder and awe. These proposals make having children to something more like pre-ordering a car. To many people the moment of conception is the start of life, touched by God and not to be interfered with or abused out of selfish human motives. Dr. Mark Hughes, who helped pioneer the procedure, intended it to be used to prevent disease and 'your gender is not a disease, last time I checked. And I don't think doctors have any business being there' 1.Furthermore, In the view of many, the new technologies are not morally different from abortion - in all cases a potential life is taken. These new technologies are likely to make selective abortion more common, as if they are legalised they will appear to legitimise throwing away a human life simply because the parents would prefer a specific gender.

            "[Doc 2198]: There are very legitimate concerns whether artificially increasing the cost of fatty food by specifically targeting it with a tax would have a significant effect on the obesity trend. In fact, research shows that a fat tax would produce only a marginal change in consumption – not the dramatic shift in public awareness the proponents of the fat tax are hoping for. The reason, LSE researchers believe, is simple: “those on the very poorest diets will continue to eat badly.” Other than the economic reasons for such behavior, it could be argued that is also a thing of habit and culture: fast fatty food is quick, accessible and tasty. It also seems that the fast fatty kind of food is fulfilling a specific need, a need for a quick, tasty and filling meal, something people consider worth paying good money for. The fight against obesity ought to be multifaceted, complex and well thought out – and a fat tax is none of those things. We should approach the issue with more cunning and introduce other programs: such as increasing the availability of healthy food by introducing healthy vending machines;  and, most importantly, proper education on the topic if we want to create lasting change.\n",

The World Health Organization, the US, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Germany, the European Parliament and medical societies (such as the American Medical Association) classify obesity as a disease.

            "[Doc https://asmbs.org/patients/disease-of-obesity/]: The disease of obesity is characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat. However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity.\n",

I automatically look for their motive and find ways in which their actions aren't purely evil, and where the situation could have been resolved without killing them or completely wrecking their life's work. In films where 'the hero wins' and 'the villain loses', the morality is entirely bipolar, teaching children that some people are good and some people are evil and we shouldn't question this. This kind of thinking isn't what we need in a situation where it has already caused wars. In original versions of fairy tales, the morality is often quite complex, with main characters performing evil actions, the most unsympathetic people turning out not to be evil and nothing being as it seems. Fairy-tale magic isn't something 'good' or 'bad', its something untrustworthy, a bargain that you don't know the conditions of, with dire consequences if it isn't kept.\n",
            "[Doc 1345]: Whilst it might be agreed that violent video games in the hands of a person who is old enough to see them and be able to understand the context in which the violence is being wrought is acceptable, this may not be true of younger people who acquire games. Games with violent content are often easily acquired by players too young to purchase them. They may also gain access to them at home from older siblings. Because children do not have fully developed mental faculties yet, and may not clearly separate fantasy from reality, exposure to violent games can have a large impact upon children. This has a greater impact than children seeing films that feature realistic violence because whilst a child might get bored with films owing to the lack of interaction with the medium, this is much less likely to be the case with, for example, a military shooting game, which a child might play over and over As such, all violent video games should be banned to prevent their acquisition by young children either by accident, or owing to parental ignorance.

It is difficult to say precisely how much good a person may bring. However, it is fair to assume that saving five people brings with it a greater chance of higher levels of ‘good’.

            "[77/185] Summarizing: Sigmund Freud: A timeless genius or overrated?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 342]: In modern psychology, emphasis is placed on empirical research and evidence-based practices, and Freud’s work often falls short in meeting these criteria, especially with regard to his incomplete and subjective record taking and data collection. Sources have since emerged that criticize his standards and methods as lacking integrity , suggesting that he may have twisted facts in certain cases to suit his theories. It’s also been said that he have burned or destroyed many of papers and case notes over the years, so proof is elusive. In addition, it’s known that Freud didn’t welcome criticism or discussion. For example, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung was banished from professional circles after he dared to question Freud, who saw himself as the only authority on psychoanalysis, thereby limiting what could have led to expanded discussion and discoveries of other thought leaders of the time. These examples have led some professionals over the years to consider him overrated in terms of scientific validity.\n",
            "[Doc 681]: Some critics argue that Freud’s theories have limited applicability. This may be because Freud mostly looked at what was going on inside a person’s head and didn’t pay much attention to how external influences, like social circles, living circumstances or financial situations could be affecting his patients. Not to mention, he refused to treat people unless they could pay him , which meant by default that he was only servicing a certain, i.e., wealthy, portion of society, thus limiting his exposure to issues. Freud’s focus on sexual explanations for psychological incidents has been seen as simplistic. For instance, Freud’s focus on the idea that dreams divulge the causes of people’s sexually repressed desires or sexual dysfunction has been criticized by some modern psychologists who argue that dreams can have a variety of meanings outside of repressed or dysfunctional sexuality.\n",
            "[Doc 1204]: Freud’s exploration into the complexities of motivation, his examination of human sexuality, as well as the inspiration behind the creative process, inspired many philosophers, scholars, and artists . Throughout the 20th century, his techniques of dream analysis and free association profoundly impacted the Surrealists , like Salvadore Dali, among others. They drew inspiration from Freud’s theories, embracing the subconscious, the dreamlike and free association in their artistic expressions. Freud also wrote essays on famous artworks, including The Moses of Michelangelo , and even published an entire book on Leonardo da Vinci , exploring the artist’s childhood, sexuality and how they informed his art as an adult. Freud’s essays showed unparalleled analysis and observation, which explains why he posthumously won the Goethe Prize , Germany’s greatest literary prize, in 1930. His ability to clearly express ideas for people across the sciences and the arts is a testament to Freud’s unique ability to bridge the gap between intricate psychological concepts and the broader artistic community.\n",
            "[Doc 497]: Freud’s groundbreaking work in developing psychoanalysis laid the foundation for modern psychology. Throughout the early 19th century, pre-Freud, psychological treatment for people who suffered from mental illness didn’t really exist . Back then, those who suffered from mental illness were typically sent to prisons or asylums. Experts at that time resorted to hypnosis or dubious treatments that included static electricity or bloodletting, among others. Drugs were also used, but more to subdue patients rather than treat them. The overriding conclusion pre-Freud was that mental illness was a result of physical impairment to the brain. His pioneering ideas sought to look deep into the human psyche and seek insights into the sources of people’s emotional conflicts. In so doing, he transformed people’s understanding of human behavior, especially with regard to treating mental disorders instead of just (mis)classifying them. Worth nothing is that nearly 20% of Americans experience mental illness. How different would their lives – and the lives of their families – look today without Freud’s impact?\n",
            "[Doc 154]: It wasn’t until the end of the 19th century when Freud introduced – and popularized – the brand-new approach about focusing on the human soul as part of understanding the driving force behind human behavior. He was the first one in his field to consider and explore the concept of the conscious, pre-conscious and unconscious . He pointed out that the majority of what we experience and act upon are based on forces – emotions, memories, impulses – that we aren’t really aware of. Freud opened humanity’s eyes to the radical idea that most of what drives us is buried deep in our psyche. Without Freud, we wouldn’t recognize concepts like defense mechanisms , the Oedipus complex , ego, repressed emotions , sexual desire, the importance of early childhood experiences or dream analysis and how they all explain the intricacies of the human psyche.\n",
            "[Doc 325]: Freud’s theories were developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and they were influenced by the cultural and societal norms of his time. Critics argue that his ideas, particularly those related to sexuality, psychosexual stages of development, and gender – specifically the female identity – are outdated and reflect the biases of his era. His theories, like women’s “rape fantasy,” were developed during a time when societal attitudes towards sexuality – and femininity in general – were much more conservative (or downright sexist ), which may have influenced his views on the subject. After all, back then, femininity only existed in direct relation to masculinity, and women were viewed as feeling morally inferior to men (hence, they suffered from “ penis envy “), issues that Freud claimed could never be solved.\n",
            "[Doc 3140]: I think that as long as our societies morality standing continues to crumble, there isn't much point in pushing for stricter discipline. You can hit a student every day over the head with a ruler, and there will still be rebellion. Huckleberry Fin was proof of that and I think Mark Twain was a genius for saying so. I do agree that something needs to be done about the problem with the younger generations crumbling morality, however, stronger discipline is not the solution.\n",
            "[Doc 496]: As opposed to psychoanalysis, CBT does not address childhood experiences or other family-oriented feelings. These issues might play a big role on one’s behavior or on their growth as an individual. According to Freud, the Oral, Anal and Phallic stages are critical in a baby\\toddler’s life and sculpt the way they will act in the future. According to The Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as an Anti-Depressive Treatment is Falling: A Meta-Analysis , CBT might only be a temporary solution for a bigger problem that needs to be confronted.\n",
            "[Doc 317]: The U.S. Constitution aims to shape the American nation and give it character. It is the everlasting and timeless written spirit of the United States. Let’s look at the Founding Fathers, however questionable their personal lives and decisions were back then regarding racism. Did they think that racism should be included in the Constitution? It’s fairly evident that the answer is no. The First Amendment is not about speech, it is meant to ensure that those inhabiting America are safe and can express themselves as they see fit, which the Biden administration is advocating through its United We Stand Summit , which aims to work toward preventing and/or countering the effects of hate-fueled violence in society. American ethos is that of a melting pot; being multiracial is one of its core features. As such, all members of American society should be protected by the First Amendment – and safe from hate.\n",
            "[Doc 232]: Anything in nature, be it a person, a company or a society, needs different things in different segments of their growth. A baby needs milk and hugs just as older children need a richer diet, hugs and limits. Starting a country needs revolutionaries, but running it takes administrators. We needed religion to turn humans into societies, but that was 50,000 years ago. We have since developed rules, laws and, in the U.S., the Constitution. Scriptures gave us rules that addressed the times in which they were written. The Bible declares stoning as the punishment for planting two different crops side by side but says nothing about cyberbullying. While their key values are timeless, most religions are based on texts that don’t address our modern lives and dilemmas, at least not without significant interpretation. It’s therefore not surprising that America’s religious landscape is growing smaller. While 65% of Americans once identified as Christian, this number has fallen to 12 percentage points over the last decade.\n",
            "[Doc 244]: The study of Great Literature divides us into two camps: those who get it, and those who don’t. Whether it’s the complex language or dynamic concepts, classic literature can alienate readers, especially if the only way to understand it is through a course load. Take Ulysses . It’s supposed to be genius, but if readers can’t grasp it after hours of study, then they might think literature isn’t for them. They may, therefore, lose touch with books and drift, instead, to more accessible and less challenging texts; they may even drift out of literature altogether – essentially making Great Literature literature’s own worst enemy.\n",
            "[Doc 1088]: There are few basketball players who are as memorable as Magic Johnson . Magic was a one-of-a-kind basketball genius: a 6-foot 9-inch Point Guard (PG), with amazing offensive capabilities. He was known for his absolute control of the ball, his brilliant passes and, especially, for his trademark “no-look” passes (video to follow). His flashy, “street-ball” style of play was artistic and inspirational. Even today, he is considered one of the most gifted players in the history of the game. Magic put the showtime in the “ Showtime Lakers ” of the 80`s. They were one of the most fascinating and mythical teams, mostly due to Magic`s style.\n",
            "[Doc 792]: Wenger’s part in Arsenal’s success is overrated. Rather than attributing Arsenal’s achievements to Wenger’s coaching abilities, they should be attributed to the great vision and fantastic work of the board, led mostly by Vice-Chairman David Dean. When Wenger didn’t want to pay more than £8M for Sylvain Wiltord, Dean recruited him for £13M, and Wiltord eventually became an Arsenal star, playing a huge role in the club’s 2001/2002 Premier League victory. It was Dean’s persistence that brought in the star players who made Arsenal so great. Tony Adams, an Arsenal legend and captain, once said: “ Coaching wasn’t Arsène’s strong point .” Wenger’s strength wasn’t in on-field coaching but in identifying and nurturing young talent.\n",

He means by that, himself (who has a job making millions talking about football and can then claim to be a big champion of changes as he beats the GLT drum) and all those rich managers and footballers who can't take losing and will look for any scapegoat for their loss (it wasn't them being overpaid, overrated and not having the committment, skill, tactics etc but rather because the technology is not there!) He doesn't mean by 'the world of football' the ACTUAL WORLD OF FOOTBALL.....i.e. the thousands of football clubs all over the world plus the millions of players and supporters. However, the media is busy at the moment pumping a very one sided argument (as well as it being an irrational one) in favour of GLT, so the TV watching sheep will most likely repeat what they hear. No doubt FIFA and manufacturers will get very rich on the introduction of any such technology....endorsements etc. But all of this contradicts the idea of the South Africa 2010 world cup...opening football to the poor etc. In reality football would became a nintendo game on the pitch for the elite-rich.....with the rest of the world playing a game with very different equipment and different rules and standards.\n",
            "[Doc 3728]: Raymond is a very exaggerated stereotype. He has an extreme disability - he is very rigidly bound by a schedule, he cannot do much without assistance, he has serious communication difficulties. His mathematical gift is very extreme. Most people with autism don't have genius-level intelligence or specific skills, and while they have significant difficulties that affect them in every aspect of day-to-day life, it doesn't completely disable them. Also, if memory serves me correctly, he has no physical coordination problems. He makes a poor model of a person with autism. This has now become the most popular stereotype of a person with autism, so people assume that when they meet a person with autism, they will be 'like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man'. Films such as Rain Man have another less well known negative aspect - they all feature male autistic people. Females with autism are very heavily under-represented. Not only are they a small minority anyway, they are more difficult to diagnose because the female social role encourages women to hide behaviour traits that would lead to a diagnosis of autism, and the fact that almost every single stereotype of an autistic person is male, while female autism is actually very different to male autism, means that people who see a woman with autism might not associate them with stereotypes of autism.\n",
            "[Doc 3463]: Generally, people can not live isolately as they have a lot of relationship and contacts with others. intentionally or unintentionally, their actions may have less or more effect on others. Imagine how a mum feel when seeing her child takes drugs or do something harmful to his health? Furthermore, what a leader or influential person does often have great impact on other people. It can lead to copy-cat or imitation.\n",
            "[Doc 3451]: Sure, everybody's in need but that is no excuse to bother a homeless person sleeping in a garbage can or pooping in the park It is horrible enough that this person has to sleep there or poop there, the indignity of his/her circumstances is only worsened with your pity or your food throwing or what you call help. Every human being has the right to be left alone and not be judged or interfered with.\n",
            "[Doc 4073]: Whether or not a god or gods actually exist, is irrelevant. What matters are the actions of the people who believe or don't believe. So long as people are doing 'good things', it doesn't matter whether they do that because they believe it will get them into heaven (or not into hell), or because they feel some natural affinity towards other humans, because they both share the same result. Bad things, as well, tend to be done by both theists and atheists. Again, it doesn't matter whether they do it because they believe the people they kill deserve it for religious or political reasons: the fact remains that we can do little to resolve either dispute.\n",

            "[Doc 3210]: Mandatory national service in any form is philosophically unjust because it is necessarily a violation of the most essential liberty of liberal societies: free action. Only in times of compelling state interest might a government even begin to make a claim that the social contract allows conscription or other coercive acts. It is for each citizen to decide whether they wish to join the army, spend a year teaching in an at-risk school, or undertake any other service project, or whether they prefer to pursue a career, education, or a form of service to a church or Non-governmental organisation.\n",

Despite facing significant scientific and ethical criticisms, Freud’s concepts continue to be adapted, explored, and debated, underscoring their relevance in contemporary therapy and popular culture.

Dec 6, 2024 · Exploring the controversial legacy of Freud ’s theories and their impact on psychology Jun 14, 2025 · Sigmund Freud , a towering figure in the history of psychology, has left an indelible mark on the field through his pioneering work in psychoanalysis. His theories, which include concepts such as the id, ego, and superego, continue to influence contemporary thought, despite the controversies and debates surrounding their scientific validity. This article seeks to explore Freud ’s legacy by ... Was Freud a scientist? Psychoanalysis is routinely dismissed because it is unscientific; however, developments in evolutionary psychology and more recently neuroscience recommend a more balanced assessment of Freud ’s legacy. During the latter half of the 20th century, Freud ’s scientific reputation sank to an unprecedented low. What did Freud say about psychology? According to Freud , ‘our civilization is built on the suppression of our drives’. 3 In the 1890s, Freud had written the posthumously published (and titled) Project for a Scientific Psychology, in which he attempted to integrate constructs that would become central to psychoanalysis and neurology. Is Freud regressive? Today, the majority of mental health practitioners, including those who are trained in psychoanalysis, view Freud's controversial theories as regressive and believe that most feminist critiques of Freud, particularly those about penis envy and female hysteria, are valid and justified. Was Freud a progressive? Though Freud and some of his theories are considered by some to be regressive today, he would have likely been considered a progressive within the milieu of the 19th-century bourgeoise, Jewish, Viennese enclave in which he developed those theories.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 698]: As time goes on, there are fewer living Holocaust survivors . This means that there are fewer witnesses to the Holocaust’s events. Time is of the essence; letting kids hear survivors’ testimonies directly is more impactful than just reading stories , and schools should jump on the opportunity to have survivors speak to the kids while they’re still here. Many Holocaust deniers overlook the overwhelming evidence of the Holocaust, and without survivors to contradict them, the tragedy of the Holocaust is in danger of being minimized. For example, in Poland, a controversial bill was signed into law in February 2018 that advocates for criminalizing the mention of Poland’s role in the Holocaust , which may eventually erase the Holocaust from Polish history. Without mandatory Holocaust education, it would be too easy for the world to forget or even deny what happened.\n",
            "[Doc 223]: Curriculum constraints and the limited time in which students are allocated to explore such a broad topic may cause Holocaust education to backfire. To illustrate this, research done by the University College London on Holocaust education showed many flaws in their subjects’ (secondary school students) knowledge of the Holocaust. Many of these students thought that Hitler was the sole perpetrator of the Holocaust, and relied on harmful stereotypes when explaining why Jews were the primary victims. If this is the misinformation that students emerge with after receiving Holocaust education, then it may be better to leave it out of the curriculum altogether or wait until they are more mature.\n",
            "[Doc 1109]: Continuously teaching about the Holocaust has the potential to blind students to how repentant Germany is today for its past actions; just ask the estimated 25,000 Israelis who live in Germany today. Another example: the German organization March of Life encourages young Germans to meet with Holocaust survivors, uncover their own difficult family histories, and organize marches around the world under the banner of “Never Again.” In Germany, there’s a collective guilt about Jews and the Holocaust, and many people think that it’s holding Germany’s citizens captive . Making Holocaust education mandatory may keep the world from moving on, and it is unfair to hold modern Germany accountable for its predecessors’ actions.\n",
            "[Doc 3536]: On the disparity between private and state schools, the correct way to improve the education for children in state schools is to spend more money on state schools, devote more time, energy and enthusiasm to them. Preventing a minority from having a certain type of education is not the way to help improve the majority’s education. By and large, the complaint is that private schools are doing well and providing a good education, whilst state schools lag behind. It is in all our interests to set the standard of education as high as we can – you do this by raising state schools to the supposed standard of private schools, not by depriving children of a private education.\n",
            "[Doc 297]: Although the Holocaust happened eight decades ago, there’s some evidence that it has had long-lasting traumatic effects on younger generations that didn’t experience it firsthand. Grandchildren of survivors report emotional difficulties that follow them into adulthood, stemming from hearing constant details about the Holocaust from family members. As there is a lot of sensitive material used in Holocaust education, including graphic imagery and details of torture, it may have emotionally damaging effects on young people. This kind of heavy subject matter should not be forced upon students who may not be emotionally ready or able to handle it.\n",
            "[Doc 198]: The Holocaust was a unique historical event in that it engulfed entire countries in hate and compliance. Teaching about the Holocaust is important to make students aware that under the “right” circumstances, anyone can get caught up in allowing violent crimes to be committed or even committing them themselves for what are perceived as the right reasons. The relevance of this Holocaust lesson was demonstrated by the post-Holocaust Milgram experiments . Participants were brought into a lab and told to administer electric shocks to a person in another room, should that person answer questions from a “memory test” incorrectly. Sixty-five percent of the participants continued to give shocks up to the highest, deadly level of 450 volts because the head of the experiment told them to keep going. In other words, these experiments showed how humans are conditioned to obey authority , to the extent that they would kill another person if told to do so. The Holocaust is a crucial, illustrative lesson on how almost anyone can be engulfed in and justify violent racism; this lesson must be taught to impressionable schoolchildren to prevent it from happening again.\n",
            "[Doc 2292]: The state funds the education system through taxation. Parents who do not send their children to state schools still pay those same taxes. Therefore, these taxes are spent on a smaller number of schools and there is more money per child in the state sector than there would be if we banned private education. In 2008 there were 569,080 students in independent schools in England,(BBC 2009)  - this would be a very large extra burden for state schools to bear. These students’ parents are therefore not only paying for their own children but also for students to study at state schools as well.\n",
            "[Doc 243]: The subject of the Holocaust provides the basis for examining simple and complex moral issues. For example, in the movie Freedom Writers (which is based on a true story), a high school teacher uses the Holocaust to teach lessons about tolerance to at-risk youth who had been engaged in race wars. Teaching children or teenagers about the Holocaust can provide them with concrete examples of the detrimental effects of bullying and racism. Additionally, discussing such topics helps students develop their own critical thinking about morality and how they can spread tolerance in the world. Today, when anti-Semitism is not only on the rise but getting more mainstream , it is all the more important to teach teenagers about the dangers of anti-Semitism in the hopes of preventing more hate crimes targeted at Jews from occurring.\n",
            "[Doc 2406]: While we may be equal we are not equal in terms of interests in study. Education to 21 can’t just mean ‘everyone should go to university’. Already around 6% of first year university students drop out,  making university an only compulsory option would not benefit these young people let alone many of those who currently don’t consider university. There therefore needs to be a wide variety of options to continue studying. This has several advantages; it ensures that the increase in young people in education can be absorbed quickly; FE Colleges would take some, companies doing apprenticeships would take others, rather than all the burden falling on Universities. This fits with the government’s plan to have three million apprenticeships by 2020. Mandatory education requires some form of enforcement. However should they never have enrolled they would not be eligible for any benefits. It might be mandatory simply to enrol but there be no penalty for not turning up. There could be a fine (but this would be unfair on the poorest). How about linking it to the right to vote?\n",
            "[Doc 2281]: The state funds education using taxes taken from everyone in society, not just those who have children. Therefore the state has a duty to benefit the whole of society, not just parents and children, when funding education. It is therefore entirely legitimate for the state to use schools to fulfil other societal purposes. A good example of this is the question of teaching citizenship in schools: it does not necessarily help children to pass exams, and so schools do not have a strong incentive to insure that children are taught it. However, it fulfils government goals of helping to ensure that people become functioning members of our democracy. When schools are privatised it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to ensure that such agendas are followed in schools.\n",
            "[Doc 4035]: Whilst the tables do show that girl schools our perform boys and co-ed schools, this may not be a factor which supports the idea of girls achieving at a higher rate in single sex schools. There are other factors which might shed light on why girls schools tend to top the league tables. It could be that teachers prefer to work in girls schools. Girls are perceived to be less dangerous and boisterous, even in this day and age. If more teachers apply to girls’ schools then these schools can take the best ones, leaving the less inspiring teachers to go to the local boy’s school or co-ed school. With this occurring, girls are getting far better chances in life as they are receiving better teaching. If all schools were co-ed, then everyone would have equal opportunities.\n",
            "[Doc 1983]: Incapacitation is one of the 4 basic reasons for punishment. Mandatory minimum sentences keep criminals out of society for a longer period of time than they might otherwise be in jail, thereby reducing their window of opportunity to commit crime. The criminal justice system is obligated to refrain from cruel or unusual punishment, but its main purpose is to protect society from law-breakers through various means of preventing and punishing illegal activity. Mandatory minimum sentences should be proportionate to the severity of the crime, thus satisfying the requirement of humane punishment. Thus mandatory minimum sentencing is a just method of protecting the public.\n",
            "[Doc 2601]: Tony Volk, PhD, Associate Professor at Brock University, stated, \"Overall, there is no evidence in bullying literature that supports a reduction in violence due to school uniforms.\" A peer-reviewed study found that \"school uniforms increased the average number of assaults by about 14 in the most violent schools.\" A Texas Southern University study found that school discipline incidents rose by about 12% after the introduction of uniforms. According to the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Education Evaluation and Management, fights in middle schools nearly doubled within one year of introducing mandatory uniforms.\n",
            "[Doc 1240]: The relationship between the state and the schools that it establishes and funds goes both ways; if schools accept state funding, the state is entitled to use schools as a platform for the military to appeal to future recruits. All state-funded schools, irrespective of location and student demographics but only high schools, would be expected to accept military recruiters once a year to speak to the entire student body. The event would be a condition of further funding for the school, however there would be no limits placed on a minimum number of students that needed to enlist as a result.\n",
            "[Doc 3182]: Generally speaking the better a person's education, the more money they are likely to make in the future. If the best education in the form of private schools is only given to those with rich parents, they will become the people with the higher earning jobs, while those without money to support them will be denied opportunities to change their situation.\n",
            "[Doc 2299]: Many governments make their schools give students a national test (a test taken by all students of the same age). After the tests, they compare schools and punish the schools and teachers whose students do badly. Because schools and teachers are therefore scared about their students doing poorly, they give them more homework, not in the hope they learn more but simply to do better on the tests.1 As such, homework is not designed to help the student, just their teachers and schools who want them to 'win' the test and make them look good, not learn for the students' own benefit.\n",
            "[Doc 2662]: Public schools will have to offer a better education and safer spaces for learning, and be accountable to parents’ and students’ needs in order to compete with the private schools. Lennie Jarratt, Project Manager for School Reform at the Heartland Institute, stated, \"free markets offer a much better way to hold educational institutions accountable for their failures. Under this model, inadequate schools lose money or are forced to close after consistently failing to perform… Why should we reward terrible schools with an indefinite stream of tax dollars?\" Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, a champion of the free market, argued for school vouchers in 1955, stating vouchers would result in \"great widening in the educational opportunities open to our children.\"\n",
            "[Doc 3530]: It seems silly to propse scrapping a system of education that produces positive results and successful individuals. Private education still exists because the alternative is over-stretched, over-crowded and doesn't always provide the best all-round education. The statistics prove the success of the private school system, as they attain higher incomes over their lifetime. The proposition claim that the government could invest more resources or copy other education models, but until this happens, removing the private education system would force everyone to enter a system unfit for purpose. This would be detrimental to education as a whole in this country.\n",
            "[Doc 1774]: Since education is something that the state is obligated to provide, any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state, even in private education. If religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state, which undermines the separation of religion and the state, which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy.\n",
            "[Doc 3527]: It is an inevitable feature of democracies that the rich have particular access to politicians and policy-makers. While the rich don't have a need for public education because they can pursue education for their children from other sources, they have no motivation to lobby politicians on behalf of the education system and a perverse incentive to remove education from political agendas in favour of their preferred issues and legislation. Only by forcing the rich into the same situation as the poor can we expect to gain meaningful ground in terms of education reform, especially in terms of increased funding relative to national and municipal budgets. We cannot expect education will be a national priority until the entire nation has a vested interest in the good order of the system.\n",

            "[Doc 294]: Delaying kindergarten by just one year sees a reduction in hyperactivity by an average of 73%. In fact, many children who just needed a chance to develop their skills are wrongly diagnosed with learning disabilities. As such, older students may have a stronger chance of succeeding by being given the gift of time . Whether this means more time in a familiar home environment or more time to adapt to structured surroundings at their own pace, redshirting could be all a child needs to feel prepared in motor skills, emotional maturity and mental capacity to succeed in kindergarten.\n",
            "[Doc 1212]: From as young as six months, children are typically exploring their attachment with their parents, specifically to their mother. Attachment is a very sensitive scale in that too much can result in poor social skills and too little can lead to risk-taking behavior. Many children, especially boys, are not emotionally prepared for the community of kindergarten. With another year of structured home life or daycare, a child is able to more greatly form a personal identity that serves as a platform for healthy social interaction. They bring this confidence to kindergarten a year later and thrive socially and emotionally with a more stable backbone.\n",
            "[Doc 81]: Instead of letting children grow in their own space, which may include stumbles, we tend to try to eliminate all challenges from the get go; even in harmless games, we are inclined to let our children win . However, anticipating a child’s growth, meaning setting high expectations for them, is far more influential than coddling. Exposure to more mature peers has been proven to see younger students rise to the challenge. The National Association of Early Childhood Specialists also suggests that the children being considered for redshirting are the very ones who would benefit from a focused, pedagogically sound environment, like a kindergarten classroom.\n",
            "[Doc 2503]: From the 1986-1987 school year to the 2016-2017 school year, the average cost of one year of college (including room and board) increased for 4-year private schools (109.6%) and 4-year public schools (125.7%), while median family income only increased 10.0% between 1986 and 2015. From the 1976-1977 school year to the 2016-2017 school year, annual tuition rates rose for community colleges (173.1%), 4-year public colleges (271.2%), and private 4-year colleges (213.5%).

            "[Doc 2770]: Just because a mother gives birth to a child, and the parents financially support the child does not mean that they would try to control all aspects of the child's life. It should be remembered that while it the responsibility of the parents to care for their children, it does not mean that they treat their children like subordinates who must do as the boss (in this case the parents) say. However, it is true that children are in turn responsible towards their parents and should be grateful to their parents for all they have done for the sake of the child, it does not mean that the children would feel bound to abide by their parents rigid rules at all times. A child is a separate human being with different emotions and different states of mind and parents should consider that. Even though parents may adhere to strict parenting for the welfare of the child, the child should not be suffocated with excessive strictness and should be allowed enough space to grow on their own. A child is a different entity from the parents and should be respected and treated as such.\n",

We can't know in advance whether we will be able to keep that promise – there are so many things that can crop up in a year's time that we can't plan for - it is a difficult length of time to remember things for, it is an enormous weight on your morale to know that you have to do something that you find difficult again and again for the entire year.\n",
            "[Doc 3701]: A persons views on society and how it should be run is based on their parents. This is because during childhood, the only experience with society that the child has had has been influenced or arranged by their parents. Consequently, if we allow children to vote, all we are doing is giving parents more than their own vote. Parents will be able to influence their child's vote, even if not directly.\n",

            "[Doc 169]: With regard to identity, both the National Associations of Early Childhood Specialists and Education of Young Children oppose redshirting in the belief that it “labels children as failures at the outset of their school experience.” Such a label can also create a wedge between redshirted children and their peers from the offset. As can the fact that from puberty to driving, your redshirted child may struggle to find his or her identity among peers who may range from six months to a whole year younger than them.\n",
            "[Doc 2772]: I think that kids with strict parents are most likely to go into different \"modes\" when the parents are strict to them, kind of like depression or feeling like their not loved because their parents don't let them do anything. The parents on the other hand think that their doing a good thing for their child and that it would help them go far in life and become successful. But kids do need freedom and if their parents are overprotective and strict, than that kid is most likely to go into depression or have suicidal thoughts.\n",
            "[Doc 1459]: Parents, not politicians, should be responsible for guiding the choices their children make and the food they eat, especially when they pay for it with their own money. Parents may have other reasons for wanting their children to have the meal with a toy, for example the toy is a useful distraction for the child. Governments should not try to impose their own idea of what constitutes appropriate food choices for children on parents and on businesses. Governments may aim to promote and educate, but imposing bans on private businesses goes too far .\n",
            "[Doc 548]: Many prisoners have children who are under the age of 18 , and these kids have no way to fight for representation of their own political interests. The number one advocates for children are their parents, but these parents can’t influence public policy regarding their children without being able to vote . There is evidence that children of parents with a criminal background are at higher risk of becoming criminals themselves. Therefore, it’s important for these children to know their parents are voting , because it provides them with a positive model of behavior of contributing to the betterment of society.\n",
            "[Doc 173]: Any parent can testify to the intense admiration young children have for their parents – they are wowed by the way you effortlessly remove candy wrappers and are dazzled by how you tie shoes. Children (well, the little ones, at least) believe their parents know all and that their kisses have magical healing powers. And guess what – being admired makes parents want to be admirable. Parenting asks men and women to model the behavior they’d like to see in their children. Parents look both ways when crossing the street, eat their vegetables, and (attempt) to speak kindly to their partners. Children promote emotional growth by reminding their parents that life is not solely about them, and by shining a light on their parents’ weaknesses and therefore providing an opportunity to improve upon them.\n",
            "[Doc 3860]: Societies around the globe recognize parents as having certain responsibilities. If a teenage driver gets into a car accident, it is the parents that are responsible for paying for the damage. The law in this case recognizes that the child should not be responsible. The decision to have an abortion is a serious one, as the Proposition has already agreed. Parents have a role in society to protect their children from dangers and things that may harm them. If we as a global society require parents to take responsibility, we need to ensure that they have a corresponding right to the information that will allow them to act. Having an abortion is a surgical procedure. If a child were having his tonsils out, the hospital would require a signed form from the parents giving them permission to perform the surgery. An abortion is no different. There are always risks with medical procedures and parents have a right to know what is happening with their child. The decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy does not only affect the mother. If she decides not to keep the baby, whether it is through abortion or adoption, the emotional ramifications of that decision will affect the parents as the teen experiences them. If the teen decides to keep the child, the parents are affected in more ways than one. They will likely be the ones that are responsible for supporting the baby financially as most teenage mothers are unemployed. They will also be responsible for the care of the child during school hours while the teen is attending classes. The majority of society expects no less of them. The decision to allow a teen to obtain an abortion affects the parents as much as it does the teen, and therefore they should have the right to be a part of that decision.\n",
            "[Doc 1346]: In the digital age, young people are almost certain to be exposed to violent media content, including violent video games, even if parents attempt to restrict children’s exposure to such content in the home. Parents therefore have an obligation to educate themselves about video games (many government, industry and private websites provide such information) and to help their children become “media literate” regarding the content and context of games. The state places responsibility on parents for the welfare of a child and in doing so the state can allow things that would potentially be dangerous for children, anything from skateboards to R-rated films, as long as parents can supervise their children. Parents need not know how to skateboard to supervise such activity, but should know about potential risks and safety equipment. This same logic applies to video games. To not confer this responsibility on parents is to further undermine their status as role models for their children, as it assumes that parents are incapable of ensuring the safety of their children. Practically speaking, this could affect the respect they get from their children, with “The government says I can’t,” being a much weaker response when questioned about violent video games than an actual explanation of the harms behind them.\n",
            "[Doc 311]: Many of humanity’s most inspiring leaders were not parents. Jesus, Gandhi, and even Oprah (among countless others) prove that parents do not hold the monopoly on self-actualization or contribution to society. In fact, most achievements which advance society have little or nothing to do with parenting skills, as Susan B. Anthony demonstrated in leading women to the vote in 1926, and as Nikola Tesla proved through his many inventions. Whether these figures chose to forego becoming parents in order to dedicate themselves to the betterment of society or simply for lack of want, they show that fulfillment is available in equal measure to parents and non-parents alike.\n",
            "[Doc 3557]: One reason to show that 18 year olds have a more mature mind then 16 year olds is because of the pressure of college and being on your own. When you are 18 you think about the life ahead of you which stresses you out because one day you will have to pay for everything and also if you are not yet in college you would rather have some money then your parents pay for an accident. This is false because I would like the ability to drive to work because I am turning into a responsible adult. If YOUR parents did not raise you right other people should not suffer for your insolence.\n",
            "[Doc 2773]: It should be allowed to use cell phones in schools as if there is any emergency case parents can easily inform their children. It should not be allowed to use during lectures but during break it should be allowed. And it also helps after school time as if the children have any transport problem they can inform their parents. Other than this if they have to stay at school after the school time is over for any type of preparation they can inform their parents. but there is some schools that let phones in because of the safety reasons.\n",

Childhood should not be merely about school work, family and chores. They need to be allowed the time to play outside, away from the watchful eye of adults. They need their break too. We are preventing children from doing what they naturally want to do if we prevent them from playing outside.

They would argue that suicide is never justified, even if the reasons might appear to be good. It is impossible to sacrifice your life for others, because you cannot know how important your life is to others in relation to how important other people’s lives are. Either life is invaluable and it is thus impossible to value one life higher than others, or it can be valued, but it is impossible for us to assess our life’s value in relation to others.

Suppose we do go to Mars, he says, and find living organisms in the subsurface that are DNA based, like life on Earth. The Clipper likely wouldn't be able to find life on Europa, but it could help make the case for a follow-up lander that could dig into the surface, studying its chemistry the way rovers have studied Mars's.\n",

            "[Doc 3186]: A country's biggest resource are both rich and poor kids Poorer but talented kids get lost by the grammar school system and end up taking up other careers when they could have served the nation better by getting the jobs their talent deserved.\n",
            "[Doc 1010]: Traveling with young kids overseas is physically difficult. Between schlepping them through crowded airports, having to keep them quiet during long flights, and getting them regulated to new time zones and cuisines, fine overseas travel can be exhausting and demanding. Plus, younger kids come with a lot of paraphernalia – from carrycots to booster seats, it’s a lot to pack up and carry. The younger the kids, the less mature and therefore less capable they will be of acclimating to new situations – and more likely to throw an overtired tantrum in the middle of Piccadilly Circus. While they may still feel the effects of jet lag, older children will better be able to handle its impact compared to their younger selves. Keep in mind that when older kids can’t sleep, they can at least entertain themselves; with young children, parents also have to endure sleepless nights.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 2759]: Bunch a lot of bad eggs together and they will teach each other tricks of the trade. The better bullies will bully the novices and ultimately to survive, kids will have to work towards being one of the big dogs. What these kids need is incentive to better themselves not to be taught that abuse and revenge is the way of their world. Not all bullies are equal. Hypersensitive kids could have tantrums over being told to shut up, whereas kids who are trying to always keep it together won't even squeal about a rape(and possibly commit suicide two decades later or lose his/her head or the possibilities are endless). 'Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\" but the reaction can either be subdivided into a major or minor chain reaction, the intensity of the act is not always in direct proportion to the damage done. And there's always the possibility of being wrongly accused.\n",
            "[Doc 1256]: Other successful schemes aim to work individually with young troublemakers, in order to cut their reoffending rate, for example by requiring them to meet with victims of crime so that they understand the consequences of their actions, and by pairing them with trained mentors. Overall, governments need to ensure good educational opportunities and employment prospects in order to bring optimism to communities where youngsters feel that their futures are pretty hopeless. Rather than trying to scare kids into good behaviour, why don’t we offer them a better life? Most areas with anti-social behaviour problems are poor, with bad schools, few jobs and little for kids to do with themselves. With little hope for the future, no wonder some kids go off the rails. So instead of threatening punishment, we should invest in better schools, places for kids to play and socialise, and the chance of a job.1 1.\n",
            "[Doc 1229]: Unfortunately, illness is an inevitable part of everyday life; it’s next to impossible to ride out an estimated 80-year lifespan without at least catching a good bout of stomach flu. Your kids are no exception to this rule, and their bodies will need to learn how to fight sickness on their own, the same way they may have to learn how to stand up to the bully on the playground. Kids are born with immune systems, which naturally help the body fight off diseases. Yet, it has been argued that giving vaccines to children can potentially prevent the immune system from doing its job , making kids more susceptible to getting sick in the long term.\n",
            "[Doc 1457]: As well meaning as parents may be in trying to guide their kids toward better nutritional choices, they face a formidable opponent: the fast food marketing machine that spends over 4 billion dollars on advertising a year, much of it targeted directly at kids . This can create enough ‘pester power’  from the kids themselves, seduced by the toy that comes with the meal, that it can persuade parents to make bad choices they wouldn’t otherwise make. By eliminating at least one layer of negative pressure, this law would help parents make those healthy choices that they already know are best.\n",
            "[Doc 3229]: Many parents worry about where their kids are; when they are out. In times of yore, this meant flipping through phone books and looking for friends' phone numbers; calling their homes only to find out that the kids were at a fast-food joint or party where they could not be contacted. Fast-forward into our time and parents can call their kids where-ever they are. If you don't have a ride home and are punch-drunk; call a cab and viola.\n",

            "[Doc 192]: Parents rely on school staff to make sure their kids are safe at school. This includes safety from exposure to X-rated materials , such as porn and excessive violence, as well as misinformation , including deep fakes , which they are too young to decipher. But even under close supervision, children can be exposed to such material on their own, especially on their or their friends’ smartphones ( TikTok , anyone?). While it’s true that there are many parent-control apps that filter and manage kids’ usage of smartphones, kids are smart, digital natives; they enjoy the challenge of coming up with new ways to bypass these measures . This can lead to an endless cat-and-mouse game of new measures and new workarounds.\n",
            "[Doc 631]: Traveling with kids overseas shows them how important they are to you. When you take your kids with you on a trip abroad, it is a direct way of communicating your desire to spend time with them. And, when children feel valued, it fosters a great opportunity to bond as a family. Involving your children in trip-planning and introducing new and exciting global travel experiences into their lives will not only increase their decision-making skills but also their abilities to adapt to changing situations . It will also help them develop a sense of sense of self-worth. Not to mention that overseas trips together are a great way to reduce the void that kids feel when their parents travel without them.\n",
            "[Doc 3754]: I think online classes are great. In my opinion it teaches people (mostly kids) responsibility by making them get up and take the initiative to go online and do the work without people having to remind or be on them for it. It's also good because their is no mandatory time for you to go on in the day. You can still work and then come online and do your work and if you happen to finish early you can actually leave unlike in a real class.\n",
            "[Doc 1024]: For some children, screens are also used as a place of refuge . Kids, especially socially awkward ones, sometimes lack the social skills required to make or interact with friends. They may shy away from social interactions if they feel out of place. But face-to-face interaction is a critical life skill . When we interact with others, we are continuously processing wordless signals like facial expressions, tone of voice, and even the physical distance between us. Equipping children with smartphones may increase the chance that they will choose the phone over learning to socialize with other kids. This will make it harder for them in the long term to face social situations as they grow up. Sure, the pandemic and its lockdowns altered what parents considered a normal amount of smartphone and screen time for kids. But the consequences of too much screen time – which school is supposed to be an escape from – can include increased obesity, irregular sleep, impaired academic performance, desensitization to violence, etc.\n",

            "[Doc 2772]: I think that kids with strict parents are most likely to go into different \"modes\" when the parents are strict to them, kind of like depression or feeling like their not loved because their parents don't let them do anything. The parents on the other hand think that their doing a good thing for their child and that it would help them go far in life and become successful. But kids do need freedom and if their parents are overprotective and strict, than that kid is most likely to go into depression or have suicidal thoughts.\n",
            "[Doc 781]: Kids spend most of their classroom time sitting down. Apart from gym class twice a week or so, the only time they get to stretch their legs and exercise is during recess. So, what happens when you let children bring their phones to school? The obvious. Schoolkids who would otherwise be running around, playing ball, or just hanging on the monkey bars are now sitting with their noses glued to their tiny screens. These kids will not only miss out on developing important social skills but also exercising , which is good for their physical and emotional health and also linked to improved cognitive function, better memory and better concentration .\n",
            "[Doc 2758]: Kids who commit suicide usually have problems outside of bullies. Bullies pick on kids who stand out, either by being very good at something or very bad, either way victims tend to be loners. Victims tend not to fit in. In sum, bullies pick on kids with preexisting problems. Often times bullies were bullied in the past or fit the same criteria. A bully could be a teacher's pet or a jock just as a victim can be either. The question of the source of damage can be impossible to solve. Only about one eighth of all abuse victims become abusers themselves but almost every abuser was a victim. Bullies and victims(the demarcation between the two is not exactly defined) should be counseled to arrive at the root of the problem. Since both victims and bullies tend to already be damaged or at least odd, the question of how much of damage can be attributed directly to a bully is unanswerable.\n",

I mean I wish I had a facebook account but I can't because my parents say no and I know I might be missing out on somethings but I really want to be safe, and not get myself into bad situtions.

            "[Doc 60]: Although the culturally accepted norm, monogamy hasn’t necessarily been successful as a societal model. According to statistics, up to 50% of marriages experience an extramarital affair. It’s not surprising, then, that the US divorce rates have proven that monogamy in its purest form does not always work. It’s not surprising, then, that, today, 81% of Americans find divorce morally acceptable. Additionally, along with society’s increased awareness about issues surrounding gender identity , its tolerance for non-traditional relationships may have also expanded. In fact, more and more Americans are open to the concept of polyamorous relationships and 5% are even in consensual non-monogamous relationships. Even in countries that punish people, mainly women, for marital infidelity, many still look for partners outside of their monogamous marriage. This may indicate that, in the current cultural convention, monogamy isn’t necessarily the natural choice for human cohabitation.\n",
            "[Doc 175]: Early marriages, often arranged to form strategic alliances between families, arose in an era when life expectancies were significantly shorter than they are today. Now that people are living into their eighties, nineties and beyond, staying together “till death do us part” may be unrealistic. Humans are the only animals to practice monogamy as a lifestyle. And as the divorce rate for first-time marriages currently stands somewhere around 50%, one might begin to wonder whether humans were even made to be monogamous. The possibility that humans will be naturally compelled to explore the world and seek self-fulfillment just might make monogamy a pipe dream. If a couple is struggling to live together as a unit or remain monogamous, they should be able to part ways instead of suffering alongside each other for decades to come.\n",
            "[Doc 2443]: Even pro-vaccine organizations state that natural vaccination causes better immunity. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia notes that \"It is true that natural infection almost always causes better immunity than vaccines. Whereas immunity from disease often follows a single natural infection, immunity from vaccines occurs only after several doses.\" Mayo Clinic states that natural infection \"often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.\" Kurt Perkins, DC, a chiropractor and wellness expert, stated, \"A vaccine violates all laws of natural immune defenses by taking a potential pathogen along with all the TOXIC ingredients (aluminum, formaldehyde, adjuvants, etc.) directly into your blood system. This process would never occur in building natural immunity. That last sentence is kind of an oxy-moron. Immunity is a natural thing. Vaccines are an artificial thing.\"\n",
            "[Doc 220]: Unlike most other primates, humans have many emotions that need to be nurtured and attended to. One of these human yet imperfect emotions is jealousy. Jealousy has biological roots , with sexual jealousy and emotional jealousy being the two most vicious contenders. According to Darwin’s model of sexual selection , humans adapted these natural jealous traits as a way to ensure the survival of the human race. In fact, studies show that sexual jealousy is one of the most important human emotions. While there may be a small percentage of people who are able to overcome their jealousy and live happily in open relationships, most have a hard time sharing their loved ones with multiple partners. The fact that this feeling is instinctual shows that monogamy may likely be the natural choice.\n",

            "[Doc 79]: Today, monogamy is the most common lifestyle choice, making it a lot easier to be accepted in society. One only has to look at the reasoning behind the movement from a polygamous to monogamous society in order to realize why it was natural: A study by the University of Waterloo shows that the concept originally developed when groups of people formed into societies, and people were becoming more and more exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. The way to treat these sexually transmitted epidemics was to become monogamous. Being monogamous was thought to be a safer way to live, and it transformed into what we know as parenthood once offspring came into the picture. Although we now have modern medicine, it is still safer to be in a monogamous relationship health-wise ; people in long-term monogamous marriages or relationships are less at risk of contracting STIs from each other or other partners.\n",
            "[Doc 921]: Many people feel that monogamy provides stability in their lives, especially when it comes to raising children. Research confirms that this is positive; a Cornell University study showed that children living with their two married, biological parents demonstrate less risk-taking behaviors, have lower levels of substance abuse, and are less likely to become sexually active when young. Additionally, a National Survey of Children’s Health showed that children were physically healthier when living with two biological parents than in other familial arrangements. In other words, a monogamous relationship between parents seems to be healthiest for society’s children, suggesting that this relationship may naturally be the right one.\n",
            "[Doc 695]: In all relationships, each person involved must be open and honest with one another in order to fully understand their partner’s desires and experiences. Couples in open relationships tend to be more self-aware and honest with themselves about their own sexual desires because they have the freedom to explore them. Therefore, they are very open and honest when sharing their experiences – and maybe even more transparent to their partners, which enhances their communication . Monogamy, on the other hand, may hinder this type of open communication, as the structure of the relationship doesn’t carry as much of a push to be forthcoming with one another.\n",
            "[Doc 333]: Since the dawn of time, humanity has been searching to understand the world around them, recounting stories and holding to beliefs that explain natural occurrences, such as disease , disaster and death. In ancient times, people lacked the knowledge to explain natural phenomena and so they would make up stories to make sense of the world. As such, illness was recounted as punishments for wrongful acts, and natural disasters served were interpreted as heavenly omens. The flood described in the Bible story of Noah’s Ark can be understood as an especially massive flood in the Black Sea basin roughly some 8,000 years ago. The locusts’ outburst in the Bible’s Ten Plagues story can be explained in scientific terms. These stories are, therefore, not historically accurate because they rely on an outdated understanding of the world.\n",

In 1995 the World Health Organisation found that the “use of coca leaves appears to have no negative health effects and has positive therapeutic, sacred and social functions for indigenous Andean populations.”  It may even be useful in combating obesity, and there is no evidence that coca use is addictive.

            "[Doc 2609]: Since gold is a finite natural material, and must be mined and processed at a significant cost, it tends to be produced at levels consistent with demand. Under a gold standard, creating more currency requires obtaining more gold, which raises golds market price and stimulates increased mining. More gold is then used to back more money until a point when currency levels are adequate, the price of gold levels out, and mining gets scaled back. It is a self-regulating system.

An ideal background for growing up means two parents – a mother and a father equally representing the two sexes. Growing up in a polygamous family may have disadvantages such as: a) Understanding that one sex is superior to the other when it is not represented in equal number in the marriage. b) Authorities confusion – Who should the children listen to particularly? Is the other “mum”´s word as important as the real mother´s? This might also lead to worsening of the relationship between the adults caused by envy that one partner is loved more by the children than the other or the discreditation of their authority which leads to great feeling of inferiority and frustration. Women in polygyny marriage usually do not have the say whether the man marries another woman. Being one of many spouses makes them feel inferior next to the single opposite-sex spouse who represents „the king of the household“ and the superior same-sex spouse. Long-term frustration coupled with feeling of own inferiority can result in suicides or mental disorders. The mental health of women from polygamous marriages are much worse than of those from monogamy couples and they have notably lower self-esteem and life satisfaction. More importantly we need to take into consideration the children who can not choose their family – the mental health of the parents have a bad impact on children as the development is strictly determined by the family atmosphere. Therefore polygamous marriage should not be recognized in order to prevent such harms.\n",
            "[Doc 3991]: We live in a country that is supposed to be about individual freedom. Unfortunately we have seen a gradual erosion of those freedoms. Now there are those who would impose upon others their moralities and ideas of what people should and shouldn't eat. I would challenge, in particular, those who come from a moral standpoint. I would wager that many people who think it is immoral to eat meat are also the same people who think abortion is okay. If I am against abortion, (which I haven't said one way or another) shouldn't I be able to force my moral values on you? For that matter, there are many societal issues people on many sides could challenge from a \"moral\" standpoint. When we are debating about whether people should eat meat strictly from a nutritional viewpoint, vegetarians fall apart in their arguments, as you will read in the other points discussed from a nutritional standpoint. The problem is not with meat per se. The problem expressed by many who say \"don't eat meat\" is with how animals are raised, how they are fed, and how they are slaughtered. However, passing a law that says you cannot eat meat is short-sighted.. In a free society, we are free to buy or not buy products that we have an issue with, without imposing our morals and choices on others. If you don't like how a particular corporation or farmer raises, feeds and slaughters the animals, then don't buy their meat. Or, go through the proper legal channels to get regulations passed to change their practices. Don't just legislate that people can't eat meat anymore. That is a personal diet, as well as moral, choice. Personally, practicing \"fair chase\" and obeying the laws when hunting and making sure an animal is killed quickly and humanely is how we come by our venison, which we choose to eat over beef because we know the animal has lived and eaten natural foods. Another choice could be to buy from organically operated farms which raise animals in an environment as close to natural as possible, with the animals being able to roam freely in clean areas with natural foods to eat.\n",

On an unbiased assessment, without the presupposition of naturalism, Creationism offers a better interpretation of the evidence. But most scientists refuse to allow the possibility of God creating the world, blinding them to the facts. Secular science is committed to only looking for natural explanations (methodological naturalism), but this only makes sense if you already know that nothing supernatural exists (ontological naturalism). If God intervenes in the natural world, then this can be investigated empirically and scientifically. Evolutionists assume that “the present is the key to the past”, otherwise known as uniformitarianism. They are attempting to reconstruct the past after the event from fragmentary evidence. But God was there in the beginning and so can tell us what actually happened. We should believe God’s revelation, not human speculation.\n",

The money would be better spent by paying local workers do the jobs , as they may have the necessary skill sets themselves. Not to mention, it would provide locals with job opportunities.

Because of these interactions, volunteers bring home a greater worldview that can help them raise awareness of global societal issues, to hopefully motivate others to volunteer as well.

Therefore, simply saying that there is a risk that printers will be misused is not sufficient grounds for banning them altogether. If technology makes it easier for people to do what they want, this is a good thing; if people then want to do things that we consider harmful this is a problem in itself. The solution is not to ban an entire means of production in order to stop a minority from producing dangerous things, but to educate people about the risks so they can freely make better decisions. Making it harder for people to do bad things is useless, furthermore, since those that wish to purchase a gun or take drugs can already find ways of doing so without 3D printers.

If we granted animals rights, all humans would have to become vegetarians, and hunting would need to be outlawed.\n",
            "[Doc 3058]: Animals are not the same as humans. They have different motivations and desires. They do not want privacy in the same way that humans do. If an animal runs away from a human it is not because it wants privacy, it is because it is in fear. Humans dress in clothes, due to their privacy, animals have no interest in wearing clothes, they have no notion of the term privacy. Equality is treating like scenarios alike, but in this case, humans and animals are very much different.\n",
            "[Doc 2322]: Why human rights always trump animal rights: It has already been established that laws protecting endangered species cause harm to humans by denying them the opportunity to engage in behaviour they would otherwise desire to do. The problem with this is that it elevates 'animal rights' to an equal plane with human rights and therefore restricts human life and happiness. This is wrong as humans enjoy superior mental faculties to animals and also have greater sentience, meaning that humans are aware of their pain, suffering and the opportunities denied to them (for example through laws restricting land development) in a way in which animals are not. As a consequence, we should cause humans to have less happiness in life in order to protect the lives of 'endangered species', as animals' lives, 'happiness' and suffering are less meaningful than that of humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1356]: The government has the right, and indeed the obligation, to impose restrictions that increase the security of citizens and encourage peaceful relations between them. The foundation of the social contract is the state providing security for all participating citizens. If the state believes that violent video games increase the propensity of users to commit violent acts, it is obligated to impose restrictions that will prevent such effects. The rights of individual citizens to do as they wish, and play the video games they like most, however violent, is subordinate to the government's right to increase security through the enforcement of restrictions. For example, one accepts the government's right to restrict what we carry onto aircrafts in order to prevent violent attacks. That is not to say there aren't limits to what we can carry on, just as violent video games are still available to adults we can still carry laptops and mobile phones onto aircrafts. Ultimately however, it must be accepted that the government's right to protect society includes a right to restrict the sale of violent games.\n",
            "[Doc 2409]: Violent video games require active participation and identification with violent characters, which reinforces violent behavior. Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence, and without a framework for ethical decision making, they may mimic the actions they see in violent video games. Child Development and Early Childhood Education expert Jane Katch, MST, stated in an interview with , \"I found that young children often have difficulty separating fantasy from reality when they are playing and can temporarily believe they are the character they are pretending to be.\" US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his dissent in  that \"the closer a child's behavior comes, not to watching, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm.\"\n",
            "[Doc 3986]: Animals are inferior to humans. Animals, unlike humans, do not have morals- an animal who kills another animal cannot be punished. Animals can not create, unlike humans. The only \"creating\" that animals do is by instinct only, as a means of getting food. Animals don't have rational thought. For all these reasons, humans have the right to eat animals. And in any case, most of the animals regularly eaten don't have any kind of ability to be creative or make tools.\n",
            "[Doc 1357]: Many researchers 1/2/3 conclude that there is no causal link between violent video games and aggressive behaviour. Other influences, such as social environment, family background and peer pressure cause aggressive behaviour. Additionally, even if video games might create violent thoughts, according to researchers there is no reason for these thoughts to display themselves in action more than the aggressive thoughts caused by frustration in non-violent video games, or by the fast pace of action films (rather than their content). The small number of people who would be affected by such aggressive thoughts are people who already are habitually violent. The Effect of Video Games on Feelings of Aggression.

            "[Doc 1358]: Not only is it wrong for the government to take censorship-like steps against violent video games but it is also impossible to do so effectively. Violent video games will still be available on the internet and, in fact, by restricting the sale of violent video games the government will push would-be users to illegal downloading programmes (through file-sharing systems such as Limewire) and therefore to an increasingly prevalent black market. Furthermore, most games are bought by parents or with their consent. According to industry statistics, 9 out of every 10 video games are sold to adults. Moreover, there is little evidence to say that parents don't know what they are buying because a very descriptive labelling system exists for violent video games since the establishment of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994.\n",
            "[Doc 1994]: Distinctions between violent and non-violent offences are not useful when deciding which offenders should be imprisoned and which should receive more lenient, rehabilitative sentences. The severity of a crime can only be defined by its context and consequences, not by semi-arbitrary labels such as violent and non-violent. All forms of criminality, and not just violent crimes, can have disturbing and traumatic consequences. The effect of a robbery on the physical health and psychological stability of an elderly person can be as pronounced as the effects of a violent assault on a healthy young man. It is disingenuous to claim that the nature of a criminal act can be separated from that act’s effects on a victim. As the widely known common law maxim states, a victim should be taken as he is found. A reasonable adult citizen will not be excused from responsibility for what he knew to be a harmful criminal act simply because he did not foresee the extent or type of harm he would do. A judicial system that takes the concept of proportionality seriously should be free to decide that the consequences of a robbery committed against an impoverished, frail widow should result in a more severe sentence than a teenager’s impulsive attempt to shop-lift alcohol. Similarly, the outcome of a wide ranging financial fraud is likely to be more harmful than the outcome of a fist fight between two drunken football fans. Judges are allowed to exercise discretion so that they can adapt the broad rules and objectives of sentencing to the nuances of each case brought before them. The context and consequences of criminal activity should inform sentencing decisions, not an artificially narrow definition of “violence”.\n",
            "[Doc 3595]: Surely if violent games were the basis of violent crimes, the numbers would have increased? If other factors were present when violence went down, then it stands to reason that the same factors would be there when violence went up. They didn't just disappear.\n",
            "[Doc 3593]: There might be some cases of people mimicking violent scenes in video games, but even in these cases, the people obviously have psychological problems that are far deeper than anything that can be caused by a media they won't even have been introduced to until later in their life. There are so many more important factors in violent crime - poverty, drugs, political corruption leading to lawlessness etc. that video games are trivial.\n",
            "[Doc 1694]: Humans have large brains, form social groups, communicate and are generally worthy of moral consideration. We also are aware of ourselves and of the nature of death. Some animals have some of these characteristics but not all so should not have the same rights. In harming animals to benefit humans, we enter in to a good moral trade-off to create a greater good.\n",
            "[Doc 2695]: If the existence of a 'violent gene' can be proved, and there are members of society who if provoked will be unable to control their subsequent actions, even if those actions amount to murder, then genetics absolutely must be considered in the law courts. The existence of such a gene appears to suggest that there exist people who are inherently bad. How should society deal with those who are apparently born killers? To say, as has been said, that possession of such a gene should result in a lesser punishment in the face of justice is, to some, unfair, unjust and insufficient as a remedy to the problem. But that is not to say that greater punishment is the answer either. There must be a balance between ensuring the safety of the general public and also the welfare of those sufferring from such a genetically inherent violent streak. For some, taking a step inside the minds of killers in an attempt to empathise with them is a step too far, but to not allow consideration of 'why' someone has committed a crime is perhaps a step in the wrong direction.\n",
            "[Doc 2417]: A peer-reviewed study in  determined that the competitive nature of a video game was related to aggressive behavior, regardless of whether the game contained violent content or not. The researchers concluded: \"Because past studies have failed to equate the violent and nonviolent video games on competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action simultaneously, researchers may have attributed too much of the variability in aggression to the violent content.\" A follow-up study tracked high school students for four years and came to the same conclusion: the competitive nature of the games led to the increased hostile behavior.\n",
            "[Doc 2326]: The problem with leaving the painting, the spear, up is that to many young men President Zuma symbolises what excessive wealth can ‘buy’ you. He is the figure head of the nation, the pinnacle of capitalism and masculinity, of which the penis and sex are instrumental in this image. By leaving the painting up, it encourages hyper-masculinity (which is inherently violent),  because it assumes there is an inherent link between power and the penis. This is unhelpful, both for women and men who are trying to live in equity.\n",
            "[Doc 2317]: Protecting endangered species helps protect humans: Humans actually benefit in a large number of ways from the protection of endangered species and thus continuing biodiversity. Firstly, the diversity of life and living systems is considered by many scientists to be a necessary condition for human development. We live in a world built on a carefully balanced ecosystem in which all species play a role, and the removal of species from this can cause negative consequences for the whole ecosystem, including humans. One example of this is the scrub mint, an endangered plant species which has been found to contain an anti-fungal agent and a natural insecticide, and thus holds great potential for use that benefits humans. One example of this is the Pacific yew (a tree species) which became the source of taxol, one of the most potent anticancer compounds ever discovered. This was the case with the (now banned) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pesticide, as the deterioration of the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon through their exposure to DDT in fact alerted humans to the potential health hazards of this pesticide, not just to animals but also to humans. Al this could be lost through the careless extinction of plant and animal species. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3.

            "[Doc 1345]: Whilst it might be agreed that violent video games in the hands of a person who is old enough to see them and be able to understand the context in which the violence is being wrought is acceptable, this may not be true of younger people who acquire games. Games with violent content are often easily acquired by players too young to purchase them. They may also gain access to them at home from older siblings. Because children do not have fully developed mental faculties yet, and may not clearly separate fantasy from reality, exposure to violent games can have a large impact upon children. This has a greater impact than children seeing films that feature realistic violence because whilst a child might get bored with films owing to the lack of interaction with the medium, this is much less likely to be the case with, for example, a military shooting game, which a child might play over and over As such, all violent video games should be banned to prevent their acquisition by young children either by accident, or owing to parental ignorance.

            "[Doc 2078]: A distinction should be made between socially legitimatized recreational violence- such as rugby or boxing- and stigmatized recreational violence- such as S&M . Rugby, ice hockey or motor racing must, of necessity, occur in public. Each of these events incorporates large numbers of competitors and is regulated by a referee. It is not possible for a Rugby player to be forced to play a match against his will, nor will he be prevented from leaving the field if he is injured or feels threatened. Indeed, referees can force players to withdraw if they believe they are at risk. Where violent sports events take place without any form of official sanction or oversight, their size makes them easy to detect, and legal principles such as negligence and ineffective consent make them easy to prosecute. Society permits violent public events such as rugby, while condemning violent private entertainments such as S&M partly because consent, capacity and safety are much easier to determine in a public context. In short, individuals are allowed to consent to the risks inherent in participating in a rugby match because the state- and society at large- is satisfied that sufficient safeguards exist to ensure that players’ consent is informed – that the risks they will be exposed to are foreseeable. This level of control and accountability cannot be generally guaranteed within individuals’ private sexual relationships. Although S&M practices, when properly conducted, do not carry a risk of permanent harm and are not likely to result in non-consensual activity, oversight of participant’s behavior is simply not possible. Sexuality is inherently private and individual sexual acts are closed off from public discussion.\n",
            "[Doc 406]: The 17th-century thinker Thomas Hobbes famously described the lives of humans in their “natural condition” prior to the development of civil society as “nasty, brutish, and short.” The idea that humans are more violent without the architecture of the state to control them is supported by both archaeological and contemporary observations . The chances of dying at the hands of another human is generally higher in non-state societies, and one widely quoted estimate by psychologist Steven Pinker places the death rate resulting from lethal violence in ancient non-state societies, based on archaeological evidence, at a shocking 15% of the population. This is compared to 3% in the modern era .\n",

Since Hollywood gets it wrong, and it’s actually very difficult to kill another human being, the general public is relatively unaware of reflex training — the training responsible for 90% of American soldiers firing at Vietnamese soldiers. There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”.

On the contrary, there is abundant evidence that war is a comparatively recent cultural addition to the human repertoire, acquired within the last 10,000 years or so as a result of several factors, including the invention of agriculture – resulting in the accumulation of valuable material resources that lend themselves to being stolen as well as defended, along with enabling the construction of elaborate social hierarchies – plus increasingly effective technologies for communication, coordination and killing.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1134]: While research suggests that divorce does have an impact on children, it fails to take into account the permanent emotional damage children suffer when they are forced to live under the same roof as parents who can’t get along. A good divorce can be better than a bad marriage for the children involved. This is because it provides kids with a calmer emotional baseline , educating them on compromise and helping them place personal happiness as a life priority.\n",
            "[Doc 1103]: Regardless of the circumstances, divorce may cause a degree of emotional pain and detachment from a way of life you have grown accustomed to. Even if you have children with you, it is not the same as being with an adult partner. Studies have found that divorce affect men’s biological, psychological, social, and even spiritual health due to their lack of social support . The loneliness that tends to accompany the dissolution of one’s marriage can be intense and may often feel like it will never end. It can also be associated with worse physical and mental health , more so for men than women, who are more likely to develop related suicidality after a separation. What’s more , children of divorce often feel lonely and devastated by the breakup of their families, a fact any devoted parent must consider.\n",
            "[Doc 156]: Marriage is an institution meant to promote and safeguard relationships. However, if those relationships turn sour – whether due to infidelity, physical or emotional abuse, or incompatibility, divorce can be a positive channel that can help free affected partners from their suffering. It can consequently prevent the development of physical, emotional or mental health consequences. Divorce also enables incompatible partners to go their separate ways. Armed with the knowledge and experience acquired during their first marriages, divorcees have a better perspective of what they want and need in a new partner. If harnessed, this know-how can serve divorcees and help them find more compatible partners the second time around.\n",
            "[Doc 4075]: A contract that clearly determines the division of wealth and other matters shortens and simplifies the divorce process. The constant bickering over who gets what is a great emotional damage that can be countered by pre-nups. During a divorce process where a pre-nup is considered the parties get what they agreed on. Their tension and anger towards each other is minimized and they can go their separate ways in a more humane and civilized way. This is especially important to couples with children. Children suffer greatly during divorce procedures as they dehumanize former partners and turn them against each other. When relations spoil to that extent children get the greatest share of emotional trauma. We don't think that anybody should suffer to that extent and this is why people should be allowed to counter this sort of damage by entering into pre-nups. Lengthy divorce battles may not always produce fair outcomes. The person who is more prone stress, will at some point no doubt feel that s/he will do whatever only to end the nightmare of courts. This may entice him to give ground on certain matters, for example relinquish some of his property, only to reach a settlement faster. This outcome may not be fair, because the person is acting under the duress. Pre-nuptial agreements present a fairer distribution of resources, because they have been signed voluntarily by both parties without pressure.\n",
            "[Doc 568]: In 2014, Paltrow divorced her husband, Chris Martin, after over 10 years of marriage. Unlike many high-profile celebrity splits, Paltrow and Martin were determined to keep their divorce amicable. She may have gotten a lot of flak for using the term “ conscious uncoupling ” to describe their divorce, but the fact that she and Martin have succeeded in peacefully co-parenting their two children after their divorce is something to admire. As is her ability to redefine today’s modern family , by keeping things friendly between her ex husband and her current husband. Paltrow also showed the resilience by being one of the first actresses to come forward about having been sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein . In so doing, she helped start a global conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace.\n",
            "[Doc 748]: Marriage is more than a relationship between two people. It is a social institution , governed by legal, moral and community obligations. During wedding ceremonies, couples pledge to remain together, “as long as we both shall live.” Divorce devalues the meaning of these vows – and consequently of the entire institution of marriage. This devaluation promotes an overall casual attitude towards marriage , leading people to enter marriages lightly and without due consideration; they know they can always obtain a divorce if the marriage doesn’t work out instead of fighting for the survival of the relationship.\n",
            "[Doc 860]: Divorce almost always hurts the finances of all parties involved. Marriage researchers have found that women’s household income will typically fall by 41% following a divorce or separation after age 50. In contrast, men’s household income only drops by 23%. Fathers typically must pay child support and, in some cases, alimony as well. Less than half of custodial parents who were supposed to receive full child support payments receive what they are owed. This leads many divorced parents to fall into poverty, as they must also cut back on work hours to provide after school care for their children. When there is only a single parent left with the children at a given time, it can be difficult for that parent to hold a full-time job and earn a decent living.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 60]: Although the culturally accepted norm, monogamy hasn’t necessarily been successful as a societal model. According to statistics, up to 50% of marriages experience an extramarital affair. It’s not surprising, then, that the US divorce rates have proven that monogamy in its purest form does not always work. It’s not surprising, then, that, today, 81% of Americans find divorce morally acceptable. Additionally, along with society’s increased awareness about issues surrounding gender identity , its tolerance for non-traditional relationships may have also expanded. In fact, more and more Americans are open to the concept of polyamorous relationships and 5% are even in consensual non-monogamous relationships. Even in countries that punish people, mainly women, for marital infidelity, many still look for partners outside of their monogamous marriage. This may indicate that, in the current cultural convention, monogamy isn’t necessarily the natural choice for human cohabitation.\n",

            "[Doc 3890]: In an industrial society where there is considerable mobility, using gossip about celebrities to bond with co-workers can be an important weapon in our social armoury. Whereas in the past, live was stable (families often knowing other families for generations) with a minimal number of ‘strangers’, modern life depends on being able to interact comfortably with those new to our acquaintance. It is here that gossip is useful; where two people may have entirely different political views, ambitions, and backgrounds, it is, however, likely that both will have an opinion on a celebrity. Even the newest of acquaintances would be able to discuss, for instance, the Richie-Madonna divorce. Moreover, on a more personal ‘local’ level, it is also important in learning who not to trust.\n",

            "[Doc 1922]: Many human rights are not compatible with each other. If two things are both 'fundamental' then they must both be equally true and important. However the protection of any human right requires the violation of others. For example the right to security of person requires the existence of a police force, which must be funded by taxes coercively obtained, which violates the right to property. Similarly the right of a wife to divorce her husband to protect her own happiness may compromise his own happiness. A right cannot be 'fundamental' if it must be weighed up, balanced against and possibly compromised in light of another 'fundamental' right, as this would mean they exist in conflict with each other.\n",
            "[Doc 1991]: Many of the children and adolescents who take their own lives allegedly as a result of bullying have a far more complicated background.

Phoebe Prince, for example, was taking anti-depressants, was devastated by her parents’ divorce, was self harming, and had already attempted suicide after a break up. And that was long before she was allegedly bullied to death . She was a very troubled young woman, and anything could have pushed her over the edge.

There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",

The revelation of the Word of God has been, for a long time, far wider than the thinking of the Church, which has tended to be far narrower in its view toward ministering to the divorced situation. Our perspective on divorce and remarriage has to go beyond “feelings” and be grounded in the eternal Word of God. Divorce was never in God’s plan.

            "[Doc 1286]: Many matadors are gored each year. In 2010, famed matador Julio Aparicio was gored in the throat by a bull during the Festival of Saint Isidro. The bulls horn went through his neck and throat and up through his mouth. Such gruesome scenes, and the risks that matadors must take with their lives, have no place in a modern society. The bullfighters perceived and praised as 'the best' are the ones that come closest to the bull, letting its horns pass inches by the fighter’s side, etc. The greater the risk for the bullfighter, the greater the reward from the crowd. The bullfighter is not trying to stay as far away as possible in order to make a riskless kill; they are trying to demonstrate their courage and bravery in the face of potentially fatal risks. This is yet another instance where, if the state did not step in, individuals would enter into certain activities which would be harmful to them. The need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community, which may lead many of them to take risks, and suffer injuries, they otherwise would not, for fear of losing 'face'. Bullfighting is just too dangerous to humans to allow, and so the state should step in and ban bullfighting to protect all those involved.\n",

If people want to smoke – and the owner of the public place has no issue with that – it is not the role of the state to step in. While smoking is dangerous, people should be free in a society to take their own risks, and live with their decisions.

            "[Doc 2786]: There is no evidence to show that prohibition is succeeding. The question we must ask ourselves is, \"What are the benefits of criminalising any drug?\" If, after examining all the available evidence, we find that the costs outweigh the benefits, then we must seek an alternative policy. Legalisation is not a cure-all but it does allow us to address many of the problems associated with drug use, and those created by prohibition. The time has come for an effective and pragmatic drug policy. Prohibiton causes crime syndicates to flourish. If legalisation was to occur, crime groups would have one of their major sources of income cut off, thus lessening their negative impact on society. Police would be able to spend more time arresting much more dangerous criminals, such as rapists and murderers. Overall, prohibition causes more problems than it solves.\n",
            "[Doc 3176]: Since the Labour domination in 1997, a lot has been made in the media of families who gain a lot of resources from the welfare state. Many people cite families that have vast amounts of children in order to gain more and more benefits. However, if we made breast feeding compulsory we could cut the level of benefits given to these families. If all of the nutrients that child needs are being gained for free, then less benefits would be needed in order to keep the child healthy. This would make people question whether or not scrounging off of the benefit system was a good idea with the benefit levels being so reduced. In this way, the child is not harmed.\n",
            "[Doc 1980]: Individuals are sovereign over their own bodies, and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals. Since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective, it is not up to the state to legislate in this area. Rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use, the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs.\n",
            "[Doc 3831]: The opposition has built their case on an assumption unemployed are only victims of circumstances and can’t influence the situation. Many of these people actually are just not stimulated enough to accept some job offers, because the benefits they receive provide them with the same amount of money as those offers. We can’t force them to accept these jobs if they can prove they are still looking for a job, so they continue to exploit working taxpayers. The opposition thinks the unemployed should just wait until the economy recovers by itself and starts offering wonderful job opportunities they were dreaming of. No one is willing to work for a minimal wage. The difference between receiving the benefits and working for a minimal wage is that the latter is a productive activity bringing benefits to the economy. The government could also use the tax revenue to boost the economy further. This process starts a chain reaction of working, earning, and spending, which revives the economy. The opposition doesn’t understand how work places are created in the economy. It is wrong to say there is no demand for labour. There could be no demand for the labour at the wages the unemployed demand. Companies can earn more by producing goods in other regions where people ask for less, boosting the economy there, for example in the South East Asia. Unemployed here demand too much for their level of productivity, so they are not competitive and are not worth the wages they wish for. Moreover, many of them are simply unskilled. It is easy to sit doing nothing receiving benefits and wining about the state of the economy. It is hard to motivate yourself to accept a job offer below your level of expectations or improve your skills. Those people need additional stimulus from the government to return to the labour market. The longer the unrestricted benefits are available, the longer it will take for the unemployed to find jobs, and revive the economy.\n",

Sure, the process of extraction and refinement is expensive, but the return on investment more than makes up for it. Plus, today’s innovative technologies may now be able to use fossil fuels in ways that don’t pollute. Also, the constant state of fossil fuels’ molecular composition means they don’t form other compounds when stored in canisters for long periods. This makes them easy to store and safe to transport over long distances, either on trucks or pumped through pipes above and below ground. The same cannot be said about handling or transporting nuclear energy, whose risks outweigh its extremely high levels of energy density.\n",
            "[Doc 3120]: Every decision to preserve a building or a site of public historical interest necessarily prevents the possibility for future developments. The resources required to redevelop an existing site are frequently greater than the resources required to produce a new development, and it is crucial whenever a site is chosen for preservation that the benefits of preserving it outweigh the potential benefits of allowing new construction to appear in its place, or for resources to be put into alternative projects. An over-zealous approach to preservation, be it through architectural listing or restrictions on certain types of development can in fact stifle growth and prevent the development of areas which may seriously benefit from new investment and growth. It is a fitting irony that in 2006 the Department of Media, Culture and Sport exempted Fortress House, the then home of English Heritage, from listing: a location which has since been redevloped into modern offices. Similarly, the recent Grade II listing of the Milton Keynes shopping centre, thecentre:mk, has drawn complaints from its owners who have argued that future developments and improvements will now be severely restricted .\n",
            "[Doc 3828]: The purpose of social system is the help certain group of people who are not capable of securing their own needs or exercising their opportunities. Current unemployment benefits system fails because it has incorrect goal for the unemployment benefits and doesn’t serve its needs. The current system only gives monetary rewards for job you have done in the past and with condition that you are searching for a job. However the existing conditions do not achieve the goal of the program as many individuals decide not to work for a prolonged period and instead choose life on the welfare payments. The goal of unemployment benefits is secure proper ground for people who seeking for a new job and willing to become employed again and the program should be designed to reward the work searchers and discourage those that abuse the system. The group of people who should obtain those benefits is the one that are seeking the job but because of some reasons are not capable of getting it. Unemployment benefits help this group to exercise their opportunities while having enough funds to retrain and secure the living costs. As this group is incentivized but for some reason is not capable of exercising this opportunity, government has to help. We believe people mustn’t receive money just for the sake they have worked before. We still recognize that we have to take care of your basic needs if you are not capable of securing them, but we believe monetary funds should serve for the purpose of exercising your opportunities not as reward system. The harm of reward system is that it’s not incentivizing people to get back in job market while simply paying for not working. Opposition might argue that we already have reward systems i.e. But even in these cases we say these people receive money not because they have worked their whole life but because they are the age when they cannot secure their needs on their own and government has to help by monetary helping them.\n",
            "[Doc 1934]: Whilst the rich spend proportionately less of their income than the poor, the rest of their income is often invested in other areas and financial vehicles, boosting the economy in both the short and long term. In the short term this money allows businesses to take more risks owing to a greater pool of money to offset the risk, alongside lower interest rates. In the long term, these risks often lead to innovations that help the economy overall. In increasing the tax burden on the rich, the spending and investment that wealthy individuals partake in is cut off, preventing these areas of the economy from growing. Recessions and recession prevention are often reliant upon public perception of an economy’s general health and the extent of its exposure to less stable economies. Due to this feedback mechanism, it is possible, therefore, that an unfounded belief that tax rises could obstruct economic growth might cause panic amongst the media and the populace. A recession might come about through the mere expectation that there will be a recession. In fact, given that the majority of the media is controlled by the rich, it is within their best interest to report that there will be a crisis if there is a tax increase so that they can claim the policy was at fault in the future.\n",
            "[Doc 3863]: We wholeheartedly reject the Prop’s suggestion that legal abortions are safe and present a teen’s best option, and that the danger for pregnant minors is parental intervention. Admittedly, parents in our world aren’t always what we wish them to be, but we insist that they do more harm than good. The Prop has denied the immense risks associated with abortion, which stretch from acute hematometra (post-abortal syndrome) to breast cancer, infertility, and increased risk for clinical depression and suicide. The suicide rate is nearly six times greater among aborting women than among women who give birth. These findings refute the oft-heard claim that induced abortion is safer than childbirth.” The myth that childbirth is more risky than abortion is largely based on the way that statistics about abortion-related deaths are collected: such deaths are often attributed to present problems. These are risks that parents have a right and a responsibility to evaluate for their minor children, who are by law as well as by custom the responsibility of parents. So why should abortions need consent when a decision to keep the child doesn’t? Quite simply, the nature of pregnancy in most cases necessitates parental involvement, since it is rarely kept a secret, and almost always requires emotional and material support. The law need not step in where immediacy does. In truth, each of the options, including abortion, carry with them serious and long-term risks that need to be not only carefully considered, but offset with the kind of support a parent is best able to give.\n",

Many of Liang’s supporters shouted, “All Lives Matter,” claiming that he was a scapegoat because he was not white and that he should not be jailed. However, Black activists pointed out that Liang was tried by a jury of his peers and deserved to be jailed for his actions. Using “All Lives Matter” to demand freedom for someone who was convicted of murdering an unarmed Black man is nothing more than demanding that white privilege be extended to all people of color except for Black Americans.\n",

For example, the film Hidden Figures , depicts a black NASA mathematician whose success is sponsored by her benevolent white boss.

            "[Doc 1396]: Affirmative action creates a negative workplaces for all minorities whose group receives affirmative action support. The existence of affirmative action creates a de-facto assumption that anyone of that particular minority must have gotten where they are not on their own merit, but simply because they are that particular minority. This causes people to resent the minority group for getting for “free” what people feel they had to work hard for. This furthers the perception of the minority as being inferior, and removes their capacity to be treated as an equal in the workplace and prove themselves. This assumption is not only harmful to those minorities who did receive assistance from affirmative action, but also anyone of that minority group regardless of if they were hired using affirmative action because there is simply an assumption that they are less qualified and there because of the policy because the policy exists. Therefore, affirmative action creates an assumption that minorities in the workplace are less qualified and inherently inferior to the other workers due to the affirmative action policy causing resentment and deepening inequality, not helping eradicate it.\n",
            "[Doc 536]: Not all minorities are equally protected under affirmative action; in fact, some are actually negatively impacted because of it. Studies found that, due to universities’ race-based acceptance policies, Asian-Americans are required to have higher SAT scores than other minority candidates, but they also need to outperform whites at an equivalent academic level to get accepted to schools. This has long been recognized as discrimination that favors other minority groups over Asian-Americans, which goes against the logic of what affirmative action is trying to do. With affirmative action, it can be argued that Asian-Americans are unduly discriminated against .\n",
            "[Doc 754]: Since affirmative action was instituted, the number of minority applications to university has starkly increased. Conversely, banning the policy from universities hurts Black and Hispanic enrollment , as seen by drops in college applications of such minorities in Michigan and California, where statewide bans on affirmative action have been implemented. Studies have shown that changing from race-based admissions to socioeconomic status-based admissions yield a sharp decline of Black representation and other underrepresented minorities in top-tier law schools. In addition to balancing racial inequality, affirmative action provides a more diverse – and therefore, intellectually stimulating – classroom.\n",
            "[Doc 1220]: While affirmative action was intended to help those with a history of suffering prejudice, racial discrimination isn’t properly rectified when favoring one group (minorities) over another (whites). In fact, biased selection policies may fuel resentment and stigmatization towards minorities from those who believe they hold position in the workplace or university due to policy rather than merit. Moreover, the Supreme Court’s recent decision to end affirmative action was fueled by the majority opinion that schools’ programs “unavoidably employ race in a negative manner” and “involve racial stereotyping.” Therefore, affirmative action programs may actually appear as more of an insult to underprivileged groups than an asset. This is especially the case when whites and other groups feel like their own rights – or chances of admissions at top schools like Yale – are being violated.\n",
            "[Doc 1452]: Under the policy of affirmative action, there is a real danger that social tensions become inflamed. This is because in the process of benefiting minority groups it helps to disenfranchise the majority. For example in the 2001 riots in Oldham and other cities of Northern England one of the main complaints from poor white areas was alleged discrimination in council funding. Therefore, rather correct racial bias, affirmative action may inevitably deepen it.\n",
            "[Doc 245]: Affirmative action favors non-whites on the faulty assumption that every white person is well-off, and every person of color is poor. Empirical findings from the Hoover Institution support the claim that this policy around the world actually helps upper- and middle-class people from minority backgrounds rather than those from the general population. In the context of higher education , this neither aids the disadvantaged towards whom affirmative action was intended, nor equally favors the applications of poor white applicants. To truly even the academic playing field, university admissions preferences should be given on the basis of economic disadvantage – not on the basis of race .\n",

            "[Doc 1450]: Affirmative action is required to change negative perceptions of university life. In the status quo, many talented potential students are put off applying for top universities (or university at all) because of their negative perceptions of elite institutions. This perception exists in part because of the makeup of the student population – black high school students may see a university filled overwhelmingly with white lecturers and students as not being a welcoming environment for them, and may even perceive it as racist. Therefore, it is necessary to use quotas and other forms of affirmative action, to change the student body in the short term, and encourage applications from more disadvantaged students in the long term.

            "[Doc 35]: Affirmative action counteracts internal bias . While an uncomfortable truth about the human condition, there’s evidence that the majority of people have biases that lie below conscious awareness. These stereotypes are said to have been developed as a way to lessen the cognitive “work” we have to do when meeting new people, and often extend to race. For example, studies measuring reaction time have found that people of all races associate black faces with bad concepts more quickly than they do white faces and bad concepts. Affirmative action, therefore, provides a way to alert us to our own biases and to keep them in check. Doing so thus helps us remain loyal to the values of tolerance that bind us.\n",

            "[Doc 1298]: Forcing people into community action, as the state tries to do, detracts from real community action. People naturally try to help one another out and do what they can for their communities but when the state tries to undertake this action itself it always wastes a huge amount or resources and sends the message that the job is done. In a stateless society people would know that they have a responsibility to care for their fellow man and take all the steps they possibly can to do so. This action will be more direct, enthusiastic and relevant than any taken by the government because those organising it will inevitably be in closer contact and have more of a stake with the problems they are trying to solve.\n",
            "[Doc 3686]: Military action is the obvious 'hard' alternative to sanctions. However it is not always possible. This could be because of domestic politics or because there are other significant actors in the international system who would react unfavourably to you engaging in military action, or else the consequences might be too severe. There are quite a few problems with military action apart from that it cant always be used due to politics. The most obvious is that it is an immense step up from diplomacy. The country you are going to attack needs to have done something serious to be able to justify an attack. Even if it is justifiable there are problems. Military action relies upon your country being powerful and being able to engage in military action - whereas anyone can implement some form of sanctions - and it is very costly. This is not only of course in terms of monetary cost to your country but also in lives lost and destroyed. There can also me many unintended consequences. You can intend the action to be a small police action but there is no guarantee that your opponent will see it that way so he may well strike back escallating towards full scale war. At the other extreem your actions my push a country towards falling appart and becoming a failed state. Yes it provides a very powerful tool for changing a state's behaviour but most people would believe that it is not worth keeping the possibility of military action while getting rid of sanctions. Get rid of both and you essentially have no stick at all. States do not always respond to carrots - you need to provide a big enough carrot that they can forgo a national interest afterall. In the case of two interests being diametrically opposed then this cost could be immense.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 1453]: The underlying issue which affirmative action tries to gloss over is the embedded social problems which put the poor and ethnic monitories in continual disadvantages generation after generation. This policy merely papers over the cracks by masking the fact that the failures of state-funded schooling and attempts at integration have led to a situation in which ethnic minorities and the poor are so vastly underrepresented in universities. The state should do more to address these underlying problems, rather than covering up its failures with a tokenistic policy. Better funding of state schools, real parental choice in education, and accountability through the publication of comparable examination data would all drive up standards and allow more underprivileged children to fulfil their potential.\n",
            "[Doc 398]: Life is a marathon , but minority runners often start the race from further back than do whites. The fact is that people are not born onto even playing fields, and race often widens the divide between competitors. Affirmative action is a kind of compensatory justice , by making up for America’s history of racial discrimination and giving minorities a leg up. This was President Johnson’s thinking when he signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act , allowing African Americans to exercise their right to vote. As he stated : “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race, and then say, ‘You are free to compete…’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” This policy helps give minorities the necessary boost to bring them to the starting line where privileged people already stand.\n",
            "[Doc 2042]: The rich will feel like they are receiving an unfair, ‘greater’ punishment. This resentment will be magnified by media response: some newspapers and news outlets will choose to report this as an attack on the rich just as is the case with progressive taxation which is often attacked as an assault on ‘wealth creation’.1 This may well increase the extent to which they break the law, because if you perceive the law to be applied unfairly, you are less likely to consider it to be making an accurate assessment of whether an action is right or wrong in any given situation. That is, in situations where you are unlikely to be caught committing a crime, the deterrent is clearly not the possible punishment (which you won’t face, because you won’t be caught). Rather, the deterrent is the extent to which you believe the illegal action to be morally wrong. If you believe a law is applied unfairly, you are less likely to consider the prohibited action to be actually, morally wrong, and therefore more likely to commit that act.\n",
            "[Doc 1394]: Past discrimination lingers on in society through subtle prejudice that must be righted. Past discrimination against particular groups lingers today through the perception of those groups and how they perceive themselves. By using affirmative action, a demonstration effect is created where individuals are previously discriminated groups prove to society and other members of their racial or gender group that they are capable of gaining power and functioning in the same positions of power, responsibility and success as those of other groups in society. This challenges society’s perception of these groups as the poor people in society and proves to them that the individuals of this race/gender are equally capable and deserving members of society and can and should function in the same positions of society as them.\n",
            "[Doc 1062]: People on the outermost poles of the political spectrum, meaning on both the far-left and the far-right, often view themselves as aggrieved parties. Interestingly, one study found that having faced adversity – namely violence, loss of a loved one, or experiencing illness or disability – is indeed a predictor of extreme political views ; the more adversity people faced, the more likely they were to lean to the far-right or far-left in their ideologies. Experiencing adversity may explain the rhetoric of victimization that permeates the far-left as well as the far-right. White Nationalists complain of cultural and economic obliteration at the hands of multicultural movements and affirmative action, while proponents of the far-left demand restitution for the silencing of minority groups via discriminatory legislation, the recent rise in popularity of white nationalists , police brutality and micro-aggressions .\n",
            "[Doc 1395]: Any system that does not reward individuals on the basis of their merit is one that is unjust to those not in the group that is “preferred” and therefore benefitted by it. Meritocracy is the only fair system to run a society on. Any system that does not reward individuals on the basis of their skill and effort is one that is unjust. The use of any criteria other than merit to select or benefit an individual is the definition of discrimination itself. Simply putting the word “positive” in front of it does not make it a beneficial or just system. For every act of “positive” discrimination enacted, an act of “negative” discrimination occurs against the individual that was denied a position or achievement they earned on their own merit for the person that received the “positive” end of the discrimination. Affirmative action is simply reversing the discrimination in society so injustice is enacted in the opposite direction. This is not a just system of distribution; it’s simply unjust against a different group. The only truly fair system to use is one that has no criteria other than merit to determine who receives what.\n",

Of course, speaking against the monarchy is technically an offense that can be punishable by life in prison . Laws like the aforementioned Treason Felony Act reveal the pernicious nature of the British Monarchy’s past, and to an extent, its present. Monarchies have long survived on the bread and blood of their subjects, whom they regularly plundered and sent to wars on their behalf. Add to this the English Crown’s long history of colonialism, slavery and racism – its subjugation and pilfering of nearly a quarter of the planet’s resources – and reveal a wholly inhumane enterprise.

Marriage, however, is also an institution which is continually changing with society's changes. If homosexuals were able to marry, their marriages would be more akin to gay and lesbian relationships in their current form than an oppressive traditional marriage. By allowing more homosexuals (who are naturally more liberal) to marry, they might be able to change social attitudes and practices towards, and within the institution, strengthening it and making it healthier both for society and those who are married. For this reason, we should grant homosexuals as well as heterosexuals the right to marry in order to change society for the better.\n",

Animals too express some of these characteristics to some degree and thus animals too are worthy of moral consideration. However, animal lives and human lives are of unequal value. This is due to the fact that no animal possesses all of these characteristics to the same degree as the average human, or even comes particularly close. Thus any rights ascribed to animals should be truncated relative to the rights we ascribe to humans. To the extent to which causing some harm to animals brings great benefit to humans, we are morally justified in creating some moral harm, to achieve a far greater moral good.\n",

During wedding ceremonies, couples pledge to remain together, “as long as we both shall live.” Divorce devalues the meaning of these vows – and consequently of the entire institution of marriage. This devaluation promotes an overall casual attitude towards marriage , leading people to enter marriages lightly and without due consideration; they know they can always obtain a divorce if the marriage doesn’t work out instead of fighting for the survival of the relationship.\n",

It is only by having children that we can fulfil the most natural goal of our existence. Until very recently the family and ensuring its continuance has been the goal of almost every human.

Governments are also faced with the dilemma of whether to spend such an enormous amount of money something which splits public opinion so vociferously. In the meantime, billions are still being spent on decommissioning the old ones. The New Economics Foundation contends that these construction overruns and decommissioning costs are ‘hidden costs’ that are not included in the official statistics meaning that Nuclear is actually much more expensive than is claimed. According to British Energy and British Nuclear Fuels, the cost of nuclear generation is between 2.2 and 3.0p/kWh. But the NEF says that this figure is probably a severe underestimate, with the real cost being somewhere between 3.4 and 8.3/kWh. This means that at a cost of 3.0-4.0p/kWh for offshore and 1.5-2.5/kWh for onshore production, wind is a far cheaper option than nuclear.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 124]: The use of Botox as a cosmetic agent is just one way Botox helps people to care for their bodies. It helps MS patients overcome overactive bladder muscles; it can be used to treat muscle spasms associated with cerebral palsy, eye muscle disorders, and even migraines. Over the years, Botox has been increasingly used to help improve people’s health. Doctors are prescribing Botox to combat a myriad of ailments, including depression, excessive sweating, and even heart problems.\n",
            "[Doc 604]: It’s no secret that youth is revered in cultures near and far. Centuries of society’s preoccupation with youth argue that this trend is unlikely to change, and Botox helps people to gain a competitive edge in a youth-driven society while they age. Moreover, psychologists have shown most people harbor a cognitive bias called the Halo Effect , which induces them to believe that attractive people have other positive personality traits, like intelligence and kindness. If society deems youth attractive and equates attractiveness to goodness, then using Botox to achieve a youthful look isn’t vain – it’s prudent. There is even a growing trend among Millennials today to use Botox as a preventative measure to ward off aging before it even sets in. Given the rise of social media, Millennials may feel more pressured than previous generations to constantly look selfie-worthy – and this is where Botox can help. In fact, such preventative Botox procedures among 20-29-year-olds have increased 28% since 2010.\n",
            "[Doc 740]: The link between positive body image and high self-esteem is well established, and a recent Botox study showed a correlation to improved self-esteem and better overall health. Of 100 participants, half were selected at random to receive Botox injections, and the other half were administered a placebo treatment. Both Botox-treated patients and those who only received placebos reported improved body image, self-esteem, and overall physical health. This lends weight to the argument that the proactive nature of Botox treatments leads to better overall self-care, which promotes overall wellness.\n",
            "[Doc 592]: Ninety-four percent of Botox treatments are administered to women. This data by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reflects a deep imbalance in societal expectations upon aging women to appear young. Over the years, Hollywood has gone from criticizing to accepting those who get Botox without addressing the product’s primary assumption – that it is important for women to be young-looking. It is this assumption that entangles women in unrealistic standards that can often form into an unhealthy preoccupation with the body. Doctors and patients alike report the addictive nature of Botox treatments. Patients show up younger and younger for injections, complain more frequently about wrinkles, and, unsatisfied with their results, are more likely to seek more aggressive remedies to combat aging, including surgery. Aging women are not the only victims. Over one-third of girls report dissatisfaction with their bodies from age five. Many social science experts have located the uptick in depression, eating disorders, and self-harm in society’s obsession with aesthetic perfection – of which Botox may only serve as a quick, temporary fix.\n",
            "[Doc 178]: Botox’s promise to keep consumers looking young and beautiful contributes to aesthetic favoritism, wherein beauty and youth are favored over traits like intelligence and experience. The aforementioned Halo Effect (the brain’s proclivity to mistakenly correlate attractiveness to other desirable qualities) figures into this scenario as well. Whereas attractive people are assigned positive traits (perhaps undeservingly), people deemed unattractive are erroneously assigned negative traits and are consistently judged as less intelligent, good, or likable . In this way, beauty treatments like Botox promote the devaluation of merits that are unrelated to appearance. It also furthers inequality, as not everyone can afford Botox.\n",
            "[Doc 831]: Botox deters the appearance of wrinkles by relaxing muscles that crease the skin when you make facial expressions. Some doctors contend that Botox can be used to prevent wrinkles if a patient starts young because muscles that do not move cannot create age lines. However, there can be side effects in the form of other wrinkles . The face wishes to fulfill its design, and move. Physicians concede that by relaxing some of the facial muscles, others overcompensate, creating wrinkles elsewhere on the face .\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 2937]: Even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity. There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1369]: The argument that internet news tends to offer small passages of text compared to newspapers is to be liberal with the truth, due to the vast nature of the internet it offers a variety of styles and is arguably more likely to provide longer passages than newspapers as there is not space restriction as there is with newspapers which can only be a certain size, due to advertisements and printing agreements. With the ability to both search for and easily share content via social networks, the argument that newspapers are better as they prevent information overload feels weak because there are many ways in which content can be filtered to ensure that both the news you actually want and the style and perspective you prefer can be easily accessed.\n",
            "[Doc 4062]: Schools are communities that not only emphasize collective learning but also encourage sports and creativity in the form of extra curricular activities; such activities serve as a utility to instill societal values into the next generation. These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",
            "[Doc 350]: Conservatives have long disagreed with the mainstream media’s liberal tilt . But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted. Not only does this stop conservatives from challenging their own perspective , it also limits their ability to persuade and engage others. For instance, while the majority of Americans were taking efforts to ward off exposure to the coronavirus, a small minority ( 12% ), many of whom reportedly watched Fox News, weren’t concerned, mirroring the station’s initial lackadaisical coverage of the pandemic. Having an additional viewpoint is positive but creating a bubble (a phenomenon present on both sides of the partisan divide) is not.\n",
            "[Doc 276]: In the last few years, vast reserves of resources like oil and gas have suddenly been made available due to the creation of cost-effective extraction techniques, like fracking, which are completely transforming the US’s perspective on energy. Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006. This significantly reduced the price of gas and created a huge boom in domestic oil production.\n",
            "[Doc 1550]: One can conceive of an infinite amount of cases in which results of a think tank’s research are completely independent of their funders. Their opposition, however, will be likely to signal corruption, when in fact there may be no relation between a funder and certain results. Even if they are associated by sharing a perspective or an aim, this is not a sign of corruption or bias, and it should not enter into the value of a think tank. There has been one study of charity donations (as think tanks are) that concludes that anonymous donations are “a costly signal of a charity’s quality by an informed donor”.\n",

            "[Doc 3710]: It's not all about letting your kids drink. It's about teaching your child at around the age of 17 to be responsible about it. Everyone knows that kids are going to drink especially when they reach college. It would be better for the kid to have some sort of introduction to it, or else they will go crazy with it and end up hurting them or others. If a parent strictly forbids it, the kid will rebel and find him or her self in situations where they cant get home safe so they drive themselves, unable to call a raging parent about drinking, for a ride home. \"Rebellion\" has been seen as the \"cool' thing for generations now. Letting teens think of drinking as a \"wrong\" thing will make them want to do it even more\n",
            "[Doc 128]: You’ll probably succeed in preventing your preteens from drinking alcohol. However, once they turn 16 or so, it is likely that their high school friends may be drinking , which means alcohol could be easily available to them. So, what’s safer? Allowing your teenager(s) to safely taste alcohol under your supervision (like what happened during the pandemic, when 1 in 6 parents first allowed their adolescents to have an alcoholic drink at home during shutdowns) or take the chance that they’re consuming alcoholic drinks or riding in cars with teenage drivers without your knowledge? If your kids know that you don’t disapprove of them drinking in safe and legal environments, they won’t need to hide it from you. Plus, you’ll be able to warn your teens in a non-judgmental way about the dangers of drinking with strangers and at parties. Let’s face it, they’ll be more willing to take your advice to heart when it’s not a stern lecture or scolding after-the-fact.\n",
            "[Doc 183]: As we all know, forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest. If you allow your teens to sip alcohol with you at home, you could remove some of the anticipation and novelty of alcohol for them. In fact, light drinking with your teenage children may help them prevent developing drinking habits as young adults. One study noted that only a quarter of teens who were allowed to sip alcohol with their parents early on had drunk a full alcoholic drink by the end of ninth grade. Additionally, research has suggested that teens whose parents drink with them are less likely to develop alcohol problems than their peers.\n",

Parents would not have to take their kids to the store; if they helped their kids with projects using their computer alone. Use Ms Word; use websites for resources and information; make printouts and viola. Counterargument: Independent socialization is prime when it comes to a child's development. They need privacy during chat sessions(or at least the illusion of it; you can always review chat histories, without telling your son/daughter, if you're afraid your kid may be stalked by a child molester) Your kid will either spend time socializing on the phone or chatting on the internet; for healthy/normal social development.

            "[Doc 1150]: An adolescent’s physiology is not the same as a small adult. Therefore, their bodies cannot process alcohol as effectively as an adult in relation to their size. Although you might think you are only letting your teenager have a safe amount to drink, you actually cannot tell how much it will affect them.

Contraception is not the only answer but it is an answer. Making access to contraception more difficult would be a ludicrous idea. Why then, is the opposite equally ludicrous?\n",
            "[Doc 3932]: When the internet comes under surveillance, you will not be able to express your ideas freely. There is sophisticated software that can be used to extrapolate your activities on the internet. With this data, you can be targeted by the state or a private agency. When you become aware that this is happening, you will be less likely to express your views online. You will also fear to research certain topics. The result is that you will lose perspective, which will affect your ability to make the right choices. This self-censoring can have negative consequences on society in the long term. Besides your freedom of thought, your freedom of movement is also threatened. This happens when your online data is used to track your physical location. This is a major impediment to freedom of association. In some cases, it will affect your ability to protest injustice for fear of being tracked.\n",
            "[Doc 3627]: Just because 18 year olds are allowed to drink, doesn't mean they won't do stupid things after being inhibited by alcohol. Many college aged students don't see the risk of drinking and driving, they look at it as, \"Will I get pulled over?\" So by allowing them to drink legally, that's only clearing one hurdle for them, they will then assume that with only one obstacle left they're in the clear. That's obviously not the case. They could get behind that wheel and kill not only themselves, but other passengers, and even worse, other innocent drivers. It's no secret that alcohol impairs judgement, and an 18 year old's judgment is not always the wisest to begin with. After a few drinks, wanting to liter, vandalize, and be disruptive or destructive can often times seem like a good idea. Doing any of the above could potentially cause the law to become involved and other charges could be pressed, thus it doesn't really matter if someone is legal to drink or not.\n",

Creating a condition where it is impossible for a child to go to school is the same as violating their fundamental right to an education. There should not be a situation in which you have to choose between the tenets of your faith and ultimately the foundations of your identity as a person or your right to education. You cannot compromise on your own identity – you can't only half be you. Neither can you have only half a faith in your religion.\n",
            "[Doc 2771]: Research has shown that teens act aggressively towards authority. Teens and young adults see overly strict parents as authority. Thus, kids with strict parents are more likely to rebel. Studies show that children raised with a strict parenting style tend to be more angry and rebellious as teenagers and young adults. Its not unusual for a parent to tell a kid to do something, and they do the exact opposite, because they, “felt” like it. If parents constantly set rules and boundaries for their child, there is going to come a time when the kid has had enough. They will begin to break the rules, and feel powerful doing it. Teens especially, do not adhere to rules and consequences. They are at the age of discovering their identities, finding independence, hormonal changes and peer pressure, all of which lead to acting out against mom and dad. Trying to control every aspect of their life is not what’s best for them, because in the long run they wont appreciate it, and in turn, will go against everything they were taught just because they want control.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 145]: In high schools that teach students about both abstinence and contraception use, these programs are sending mixed messages to students. If a school wants its students not to have sex, it shouldn’t provide them with condoms to use during intercourse. Furthermore, making condoms available in schools might send the erroneous message to students that their teachers and parents are expecting them to engage in sexual activity.\n",
            "[Doc 765]: Condom distribution in high schools gives students a false sense of security when having sex. This is because most teenagers lack experience with condom implementation and use, causing the condoms to be extremely ineffective. When used perfectly every single time during sex, condoms are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. But people, especially teenagers, aren’t perfect, so, typically, condoms may only about 85% effective. Not to mention the fact that vulnerable teenage girls still have less control over condom use.\n",
            "[Doc 1160]: By providing condoms to students, high schools are taking away the due right of parents to decide whether their own teenage children should have access to contraception. To begin with, many parents don’t think that their adolescent children are emotionally or physically ready yet for sex. So, having schools introduce condom use to their teenagers pressures both the parents and teens into having conversations about sex that may feel premature. It may also interfere with a family’s values or religious beliefs. For instance, the Catholic Church and other conservative faiths oppose various forms of contraception. Parents who support the cause can provide condoms to their teenagers without having schools infringe on other families’ timelines of talking about sex and/or religious freedoms.\n",
            "[Doc 1029]: As teenagers are beginning to discover their sexual identities , providing condoms in high schools can help them establish the concept of safe sex as the norm and gives them the mandate to be responsible. Research shows that 60% of high schoolers have had sex by the time they graduate. Therefore, introducing the idea of condom use into their conscience at such a formative age may help teens view contraception as second nature as opposed to something that either gender will have to continually negotiate with future partners. Also worth noting, with the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe V. Wade, access to abortion is getting more limited across the US, which only emphasizes the need for more access to condoms.\n",
            "[Doc 3536]: On the disparity between private and state schools, the correct way to improve the education for children in state schools is to spend more money on state schools, devote more time, energy and enthusiasm to them. Preventing a minority from having a certain type of education is not the way to help improve the majority’s education. By and large, the complaint is that private schools are doing well and providing a good education, whilst state schools lag behind. It is in all our interests to set the standard of education as high as we can – you do this by raising state schools to the supposed standard of private schools, not by depriving children of a private education.\n",
            "[Doc 2278]: State schools will, like the private schools, have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere. This incentivises in particular high level management, who, if the school fails, will be out of a job with a blot on their record.\n",
            "[Doc 671]: Among U.S. high school students surveyed by the CDC in 2021, 30% were sexually active. Of these, 48% of them didn’t use a condom during their last sexual encounter. The same study also showed that half of the 20 million new STDs reported in the United States each year are among 15- to 24-year-olds, and that people aged 13-24 accounted for an estimated 20% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2018. These numbers emphasize the importance of condom distribution in high schools for sexually active teenagers. If consistently used correctly, condoms can be highly effective in decreasing the probability of STD transmission and preventing HIV transmission. Whether we like it or not, U.S. high school students are already having sex. As long as this is the case, schools need to help them stay safe.\n",
            "[Doc 2292]: The state funds the education system through taxation. Parents who do not send their children to state schools still pay those same taxes. Therefore, these taxes are spent on a smaller number of schools and there is more money per child in the state sector than there would be if we banned private education. In 2008 there were 569,080 students in independent schools in England,(BBC 2009)  - this would be a very large extra burden for state schools to bear. These students’ parents are therefore not only paying for their own children but also for students to study at state schools as well.\n",
            "[Doc 1240]: The relationship between the state and the schools that it establishes and funds goes both ways; if schools accept state funding, the state is entitled to use schools as a platform for the military to appeal to future recruits. All state-funded schools, irrespective of location and student demographics but only high schools, would be expected to accept military recruiters once a year to speak to the entire student body. The event would be a condition of further funding for the school, however there would be no limits placed on a minimum number of students that needed to enlist as a result.\n",
            "[Doc 4035]: Whilst the tables do show that girl schools our perform boys and co-ed schools, this may not be a factor which supports the idea of girls achieving at a higher rate in single sex schools. There are other factors which might shed light on why girls schools tend to top the league tables. It could be that teachers prefer to work in girls schools. Girls are perceived to be less dangerous and boisterous, even in this day and age. If more teachers apply to girls’ schools then these schools can take the best ones, leaving the less inspiring teachers to go to the local boy’s school or co-ed school. With this occurring, girls are getting far better chances in life as they are receiving better teaching. If all schools were co-ed, then everyone would have equal opportunities.\n",
            "[Doc 3888]: The Internet is a blank state, you can create a new you and the lack of formal rules mean that you can try out new systems. For instance, it is much easier to share work and distribute it for free on the Internet because even if there are legal difficulties with it they can be worked around.\n",
            "[Doc 4034]: We are smarter than you think. We have learned stuff in high school, even middle school, which you didn't learn until college. We can make good decisions on our own life. Now they are teaching life management at sophomore year in some schools. If we didn't know how to make good decisions before, now we do.\n",
            "[Doc 2281]: The state funds education using taxes taken from everyone in society, not just those who have children. Therefore the state has a duty to benefit the whole of society, not just parents and children, when funding education. It is therefore entirely legitimate for the state to use schools to fulfil other societal purposes. A good example of this is the question of teaching citizenship in schools: it does not necessarily help children to pass exams, and so schools do not have a strong incentive to insure that children are taught it. However, it fulfils government goals of helping to ensure that people become functioning members of our democracy. When schools are privatised it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to ensure that such agendas are followed in schools.\n",
            "[Doc 2299]: Many governments make their schools give students a national test (a test taken by all students of the same age). After the tests, they compare schools and punish the schools and teachers whose students do badly. Because schools and teachers are therefore scared about their students doing poorly, they give them more homework, not in the hope they learn more but simply to do better on the tests.1 As such, homework is not designed to help the student, just their teachers and schools who want them to 'win' the test and make them look good, not learn for the students' own benefit.\n",
            "[Doc 3139]: i believe that schools especially either high schools or secondary schools is like a \"launching pad\" to adult life. students need to learn to be mature and gain life qualities and values such as respect and being mature, calm and gentle. not just to people but to people in schools, it even helps u in yr life, to be respectful to ur bosses and even those under you. discipline gives birth to respect and if discipline is placed in schools then the seeds of respect will be rootly sown into children's life at that tender and learning age and it becomes part of them. discipline makes someone to stand in life, knowing that they are respectful, gentle, mature, responsible and disciplined. discipline is what defines someone as a real human being not a wild disrespectful animal\n",
            "[Doc 3649]: The production of plastic bags is a big industry. There are factories which produce the bags and distribute them. Let us not forget that these factories may cause poolution, but they also have a vast amount of staff policing the production. In the time of a recession we should not be looking to thwart thriving industries but save them. Factory workers are finding it increasingly difficult to get work in this day and age and the ban of plastic bag distribution would only make their plight for employment even tougher.\n",
            "[Doc 3947]: People teaching at schools where performance is top-notch, since only high-merit students are admitted, will get more money for less effort.\n",
            "[Doc 2662]: Public schools will have to offer a better education and safer spaces for learning, and be accountable to parents’ and students’ needs in order to compete with the private schools. Lennie Jarratt, Project Manager for School Reform at the Heartland Institute, stated, \"free markets offer a much better way to hold educational institutions accountable for their failures. Under this model, inadequate schools lose money or are forced to close after consistently failing to perform… Why should we reward terrible schools with an indefinite stream of tax dollars?\" Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, a champion of the free market, argued for school vouchers in 1955, stating vouchers would result in \"great widening in the educational opportunities open to our children.\"\n",
            "[Doc 2880]: Why should the army be allowed to market themselves to children who are too young to buy alcohol, cigarettes or drive when joining the army is more dangerous than these three things? If we protect our children from the harmful effects of drugs, we should be protecting them from getting shot as well. Allowing one and not the other is hypocrisy - and since letting 16 year olds drink legally would be a less-than-sensible idea, we should ban the armed forces from recruiting in schools.\n",
            "[Doc 964]: Standardized tests ensure the education level in America is up to par – for everyone. The US’s Every Student Succeeds Act , which began in 2016, requires states to use proficiency on standardized exams as a method of holding elementary, middle and high schools accountable for their students’ success. This was intended to close the gap between minority and poverty-stricken students with those from higher-income families. Not only do standardized tests give every student the opportunity to learn the same material as their peers in other schools, but state funding laws incentivize schools to ensure every student does well on these exams. As Washington State’s Senator Patty Murray once said about education laws, “We know that if we don’t have ways to measure students’ progress, and if we don’t hold states accountable, the victims will invariably be the kids from poor neighborhoods, children of color, and students with disabilities.”\n",

            "[93/185] Summarizing: The Perspective on Surrogacy\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 708]: Surrogacy is a paid “job” that women perform, often while attempting to remain emotionally detached from the “product of their work.” This would be fine in some work environments, but in the case of surrogacy, alienated labor that culminates in physical reproductive labor can be psychologically and physically harmful for the surrogate mother. It can also turn the entire surrogacy process into a physical act lacking in emotional attachment This is because surrogates might be compelled to sell their bodies and their function for money, while attempting to distance themselves from the significance of their acts and shield themselves from potential postpartum heartbreak .\n",
            "[Doc 520]: Today, approximately 11% of American women struggle with infertility. For people unable to conceive due to infertility or medical conditions, surrogacy can be one of the only ways in which they finally create a family . Surrogacy can help single men and women and LGBT couples become parents, enabling at least one parent to be biologically linked to their child. Plus, having kids and forming a family has been positively linked with increased parental happiness, productivity and longevity , for all family members. Some research even suggests that parents are happier than non-parents later in life , once their children move out. Basically, surrogacy can create the foundation for a happier, more fulfilled life.\n",
            "[Doc 430]: Surrogacy can be problematic in instances where it is used by wealthier people to dominate and degrade women from lower socio-economic backgrounds, particularly in third-world countries . The woman’s unique childbearing capabilities are recognized and used to bring money in. The issue of consent is at times unclear. Countries like India offer surrogacy services to Western countries at a fraction of the cost, which can be seen as exploiting women as baby-making machines for a pittance. The low price tag can be tempting to couples and individuals of higher economic means who are desperate to expand their families, driving them to enter into surrogacy agreements with third-world women, despite the way these contracts may affect these surrogates. In Ukraine, for example, couples may pay anywhere between $30K-$50K for the process while the surrogate mothers reportedly receive only a small fraction of this sum.\n",
            "[Doc 379]: To better understand surrogacy, we must look at the alternatives available to people hoping to become parents. One alternative is adoption. Despite there being many children around the world in desperate need of homes, it can take years for a single child to be adopted. Then, adoptive parents must get to know a child who is already born and who biologically belongs to someone else. It may also be challenging to find out a comprehensive health history of the adopted child, which may cause complications later in life for everyone involved. Clearly, adoption is not easy. While the surrogacy process can also be challenging, especially when the surrogate mother is in a different country where war can break out , surrogacy does ensure that intended parents can be involved in their child’s life from the get-go. Intended parents are updated on the surrogate’s pregnancy, and often can attend scans and be present when the baby, often theirs biologically, is born.\n",
            "[Doc 1075]: In countries that allow and support commercial surrogacy, surrogate mothers are fairly compensated for their time and the medical risk involved. These women are instructed about the process, what medical procedures are required and how they must conduct themselves throughout the gestational period. Contracts are signed to protect the surrogate and intended parents to ensure that all parties get what they want. For the intended parents, this means a baby. For the regulated surrogate – a base compensation of around $25,000 can be expected, though it can be more and the absolving of her responsibility towards the child and its intended parents following childbirth. From an equality perspective, surrogate mothers are well informed and conscious of their choice. The act of surrogacy can therefore be viewed as an educated and informed economic opportunity.\n",
            "[Doc 503]: When surrogacy is allowed, babies become commodities for trade , often between wealthy Westerners and impoverished families in developing countries. This international trade approach to babies, with its mixed legal systems, can leave those babies without protection or rights. A Chinese actress reportedly abandoned her two babies, born via different surrogates, after she and her husband split while the surrogates were still pregnant. Thai baby born with autism caused parents to back out of a deal and leave him with his surrogate mother. A twin baby was abandoned in India by Australian parents with knowledge of the Indian Authorities. Such examples point out the inherent inequality and possible injustice that arise from international surrogacy.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 2937]: Even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity. There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1369]: The argument that internet news tends to offer small passages of text compared to newspapers is to be liberal with the truth, due to the vast nature of the internet it offers a variety of styles and is arguably more likely to provide longer passages than newspapers as there is not space restriction as there is with newspapers which can only be a certain size, due to advertisements and printing agreements. With the ability to both search for and easily share content via social networks, the argument that newspapers are better as they prevent information overload feels weak because there are many ways in which content can be filtered to ensure that both the news you actually want and the style and perspective you prefer can be easily accessed.\n",
            "[Doc 4062]: Schools are communities that not only emphasize collective learning but also encourage sports and creativity in the form of extra curricular activities; such activities serve as a utility to instill societal values into the next generation. These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",
            "[Doc 350]: Conservatives have long disagreed with the mainstream media’s liberal tilt . But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted. Not only does this stop conservatives from challenging their own perspective , it also limits their ability to persuade and engage others. For instance, while the majority of Americans were taking efforts to ward off exposure to the coronavirus, a small minority ( 12% ), many of whom reportedly watched Fox News, weren’t concerned, mirroring the station’s initial lackadaisical coverage of the pandemic. Having an additional viewpoint is positive but creating a bubble (a phenomenon present on both sides of the partisan divide) is not.\n",
            "[Doc 276]: In the last few years, vast reserves of resources like oil and gas have suddenly been made available due to the creation of cost-effective extraction techniques, like fracking, which are completely transforming the US’s perspective on energy. Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006. This significantly reduced the price of gas and created a huge boom in domestic oil production.\n",
            "[Doc 1550]: One can conceive of an infinite amount of cases in which results of a think tank’s research are completely independent of their funders. Their opposition, however, will be likely to signal corruption, when in fact there may be no relation between a funder and certain results. Even if they are associated by sharing a perspective or an aim, this is not a sign of corruption or bias, and it should not enter into the value of a think tank. There has been one study of charity donations (as think tanks are) that concludes that anonymous donations are “a costly signal of a charity’s quality by an informed donor”.\n",

            "[Doc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy]: In gestational surrogacy, the child is not biologically related to the surrogate, who is often referred to as a gestational carrier. Even in jurisdictions that do not recognize surrogacy arrangements, if the potential adoptive parents and the birth mother proceed without any intervention from the government and do not change their mind along the way, they will likely be able to achieve the effects of surrogacy by having the gestational carrier give birth and then give the child up for private adoption to the intended parents.*[citation needed*]. Other human rights activists express concern over the conditions under which gestational carriers are kept by surrogacy clinics which exercise much power and control over the process of surrogate pregnancy. Commercial surrogacy has been associated with cases in which individuals or couples became legal parents to numerous children within a short period, prompting questions about parental motives and potential risks related to human trafficking and child welfare. \"International, Commercial, Gestational Surrogacy through the Eyes of Children Born to Surrogates in Thailand: A Cry for Legal Attention\" (PDF).\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 684]: While both dogs and cats prefer routine and don’t like uncertainty, dogs are much more adaptable than cats. This is because dogs usually bond with their owner rather than with a specific place. Recent research shows that dogs’ brains process speech the same way that humans do, understanding tones first and then meaning. It’s no wonder, then, that humans and dogs form such strong bonds given that they can communicate and understand each other. So, unlike cats, dogs are more likely to be happy wherever their owner is and will therefore better handle being relocated to new places – with their owners. You can even take your dog on vacation and know that he’ll enjoy it rather than be stressed.\n",
            "[Doc 163]: The independent spirit of cats is a virtue, especially when you’re busy or expecting company. Dogs work themselves into a frenzy, barking, jumping, and drooling on you and your visitors. In their excited bid for attention, dogs’ nails scratch clothes and their drool soils them (which is just as unwelcome for owners as it is for guests.) Meanwhile, cats make themselves scarce when the doorbell rings. Maybe, they’ll discreetly check out your guests by rubbing up against their leg , but there won’t be any overbearing leaping or leg humping. Plus, cats’ independence means you (and your guests) won’t need to give them constant attention. (That being said, cats’ independence should not be mistaken for cold aloofness. Research shows that cats, like dogs, can actually shape their behavior to human emotions and may be as socially intelligent as dogs.)\n",
            "[Doc 435]: While you can play with some cats, nothing measures up to the sheer, infectious joy your dog shows for playtime. Inside or outside, dogs are always eager to join any game and will happily play with kids and adults for hours on end. And, unlike cats, dogs can play interactively; they’ll catch a ball and bring it back to you. Not only can dogs be easily trained to play and do tricks, but they can also be trained to do actual jobs that make a real difference in society. It helps that dogs are scientifically proven to be as smart as 2-year-old kids. In fact, research suggests that even puppies with little exposure to humans can already understand pointing gestures and are born with levels of social cognition – ready to work and play.\n",
            "[Doc 50]: You can leave your cat inside when you’re not home and be mostly assured that everything will still be in one piece when you get back. More importantly, cats aren’t dependent on their owners to go to the bathroom. Sure, kitty litter can smell if it isn’t changed regularly, but you can store and change it at your convenience. Not to mention, some cats can be trained to actually use the toilet . In contrast, dogs don’t care if there’s rain, snow or extreme heat outside. When they need a walk, there’s no avoiding it. And even if you have a yard, you’ll still need to do constant poop control outside. Plus, cats groom themselves and don’t emit bad smells. Not even the most ardent dog lover can deny that their furry companion has a distinctly strong odor, which often remains on clothes, furniture and in cars after they’ve gone.\n",
            "[Doc 623]: No matter the dog breed, all dogs feel protective and defensive of their owners. Whereas cats will typically run off and hide at the first sense of danger, dogs will stay around out of duty and loyalty, protecting and defending you against any threats to your safety. Moreover, a dog’s sense of smell can also save lives . Other ways that dogs are good for their owners’ health are that they can sniff and identify chemical odors that people emit when stressed and motivate their owners to exercise more. New research shows that dog walkers (i.e., most dog owners) are more physically active than people who don’t own dogs.\n",
            "[Doc 952]: Unlike dogs that will always vocalize their moods with loud barks or endless whining, most cats will (mostly) keep their moods to themselves. Even when cats do protest, their meows or hisses are usually not as loud as barks and can’t be heard from the neighbor’s house. There’s also an added benefit of your cat’s low-decibel purring is that it’s been shown to reduce stress levels and blood pressure, among other things.\n",
            "[Doc 2512]: Research animals are cared for by veterinarians, husbandry specialists, and animal health technicians to ensure their well-being and more accurate findings. According to Nature Genetics \"stressed or crowded animals produce unreliable research results, and many phenotypes are only accessible in contented animals in enriched environments, it is in the best interests of the researchers not to cut corners or to neglect welfare issues.\" At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's animal research facility, for example, dogs are given exercise breaks twice daily to socialize with their caretakers and other dogs, and a \"toy rotation program\" provides opportunities for play.\n",
            "[Doc 3291]: Anyone who has had a dog will recognise its lack of shame in mounting other dogs. Homosexual behaviour has been identified in all species where people have bothered to look. The only animal where there seems to be a problem with this is mankind. We feel the need to label people one way or another when the truth is such labels are constricting and inaccurate.\n",
            "[Doc 3146]: Children are pretty, they give off Oxy-tocin: a chemical that makes them likable. Seeing children is pleasant and makes people happy. However, children should be told not to have public tantrums since that makes people unhappy, including the children themselves.\n",
            "[Doc 2759]: Bunch a lot of bad eggs together and they will teach each other tricks of the trade. The better bullies will bully the novices and ultimately to survive, kids will have to work towards being one of the big dogs. What these kids need is incentive to better themselves not to be taught that abuse and revenge is the way of their world. Not all bullies are equal. Hypersensitive kids could have tantrums over being told to shut up, whereas kids who are trying to always keep it together won't even squeal about a rape(and possibly commit suicide two decades later or lose his/her head or the possibilities are endless). 'Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\" but the reaction can either be subdivided into a major or minor chain reaction, the intensity of the act is not always in direct proportion to the damage done. And there's always the possibility of being wrongly accused.\n",
            "[Doc 1250]: It makes no sense to give animals rights because they cannot makes decisions about what is right and wrong and will not try to treat us in an ethical manner in return. Why make them a moral agent by giving them rights?\n",

            "[Doc 2671]: Longer daylight hours make driving safer, lowers car accident rates, and lowers the risk of pedestrians being hit by a car. Economists Jennifer Doleac, PhD, and Nicholas Sanders, PhD, found that robberies drop about 7% overall, and 27% in the evening hours after the spring time change. They stated, \"Most street crime occurs in the evening around common commuting hours of 5 to 8 PM, and more ambient light during typical high-crime hours makes it easier for victims and passers-by to see potential threats and later identify wrongdoers.\" Also, daylight in the evening makes it safer for joggers, people walking dogs after work, and children playing outside, among others, because drivers are able to see people more easily and criminal activity is lowered.\n",

            "[Doc 454]: Michael Jackson’s exploits are well-documented and bizarre, even by Hollywood’s standards. In the 80’s, his chimpanzee, Bubbles , was his constant companion. He built an amusement park in his backyard, had two spur-of-the moment marriages, and frequent changes in his appearance were ever-present in tabloid news. A former Jackson publicist alleged that Jackson’s antics were his version of wagging the dog – that Jackson leaked rumors about himself and behaved strangely to build celebrity through spectacle. Later, he tried to create marketing stunts like seeking knighthood from the late Queen of England to deflect bad press – namely, accusations of sexual abuse against children.\n",
            "[Doc 3921]: Every day, children could be in their last hour writing a story, doing persuasive writing or other important work, when the bell might ring. They come back the next day and can't remember what they were going to write. This isn't good, especially in a test, when you could then receive bad marks, which may be part of their reports. If you want a better report, to do better at school, and have a better life, I suggest that school hours should be extended.\n",
            "[Doc 2247]: Studies show that students in year-round schooling tend to get perform better on many assessment metrics than those who do not . Schools operating a year-round calendar do not have to cram so much course content into a 9 month schedule, but can space out learning better. This allows teaching to proceed at a more logical pace, helping students learn better. Furthermore, by giving students frequent short breaks (instead of two or three long ones), pupils are refreshed and ready to learn when school resumes.\n",
            "[Doc 1641]: In Western liberal democracies, we generally consider an individual’s private sphere to be worth protecting. We only give the state license to violate it when something is objectively largely harmful to that person or to society. When something is not very clearly harmful we let people make their own decisions because the state is not infallible in its judgements about what lifestyles are better than others. Therefore, simply saying that there is a risk that printers will be misused is not sufficient grounds for banning them altogether. If technology makes it easier for people to do what they want, this is a good thing; if people then want to do things that we consider harmful this is a problem in itself. The solution is not to ban an entire means of production in order to stop a minority from producing dangerous things, but to educate people about the risks so they can freely make better decisions. Making it harder for people to do bad things is useless, furthermore, since those that wish to purchase a gun or take drugs can already find ways of doing so without 3D printers. One may even argue that it is better for everybody to have access to a gun, for example, and not only those who are willing to break the law to get one.\n",
            "[Doc 1247]: It is true that animals and human beings are different. It is also true that men are different from women and children from adults. Equality does not require beings to be identical. It is true that whilst many people argue women should have the right to abortion, no one argues the same for men because men are unable to have an abortion. It is similarly true that whilst most people believe all human beings have a right to vote, no one argues that animals deserve a right to vote – even those who support animal rights. Equality does not mean that beings all deserve the exact same treatment. It means rather that we consider equally the equal interests of animals and humans. If we deem amount A to be the maximum amount of suffering a person be allowed to endure, then that should apply equally to an animal, though humans and animals may suffer different amounts under different circumstances. The principle of equality advocates equal consideration, so it still allows for different treatment and different rights. Equality is a prescriptive rather than a descriptive concept. What’s important is that beings should ONLY be treated differently where there is a morally relevant difference between them. For example, we can justifiably deny dogs the right to vote because there is a relevant difference in intelligence between dogs and humans. However, there is no justification for battery-farming chickens who have a capacity to suffer. There is evidence that they experience fear, pain and discomfort. Although chickens may be less intelligent and unable to speak , these differences are not morally relevant to whether or not they should be placed in these conditions. We ought to consider animals equally to the way we consider humans. If we were to do so we would give animals rights. We ought therefore to give animals rights.\n",

Further, will the leader implement politically popular ideas or required policies? If we are introducing quotas for women in politics we need to think about what women are entering. The concern with race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, and class is fundamental as if we accept the principle that an unrepresented group should get a quota of parliamentarians this should not just apply to women.

But doing so will depend on keeping ambitious, well-qualified women moving up the management ranks. Gender quotas will encourage more women to pursue education and career options leading to the top of executive positions. Quotas create incentives for women to adapt their job preferences to the more accessible boardroom positions and develop necessary skills which would reduce the need for positive discrimination in the future. Encouraged to develop relevant skills, women will contribute to the long-term talent pool and the economy. According to McKinsey report, women’s interest in being leaders increases as they progress from entry level to middle management  which is exactly what the principle behind quotas aims to encourage - more women following professional career development. This is very important in the short run during which, according to research, women who have high position stimulate other women’s interest in traditionally male-dominated sectors and encourage them to pursue similar career paths. \"Unlocking the Full Potential of Women in the US Economy.\"\n",

How ads attract and influence is determined by individual beliefs and values of the audience member.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 779]: Children are growing up in a world dominated by smartphones. Instead of keeping this significant societal change outside of school and trying to pretend it doesn’t exist, we are better off educating students in school about the benefits and risks of smartphone use (and overuse). This includes teaching children about digital and cyberbullying and its harmful effects and how to responsibly use various social media platforms that are accessible from their smartphones. Teachers can also encourage children to question information and sources that they are exposed to on their smartphones, and how to become more media-savvy, which is an especially important lesson in today’s age of “ fake news .”\n",
            "[Doc 1008]: Many schools today don’t have the equipment needed to make technology accessible for their students. This is where smartphones as learning aids come into the picture. These everyday hand-held devices have more processing power than all of NASA’s computers when they landed a man on the moon . So, instead of dealing with computers, the teacher can simply ask the class to scan a QR code or enter a www address that will take students directly to interactive content for the subject they are currently studying. New innovations like AI (hello, ChatGPT ) is being used by students, whether teachers like it or not. Some are even incorporating it into classrooms, so those students with smartphones will have easy access to the competitive advantage that AI gives. When in-school education was compromised by the pandemic, hybrid learning became prevalent; digital education has since remained just another way for students to learn about the world around them and for teachers to communicate with them – on various digital platforms, all accessible by smartphones.\n",

This includes safety from exposure to X-rated materials , such as porn and excessive violence, as well as misinformation , including deep fakes , which they are too young to decipher. But even under close supervision, children can be exposed to such material on their own, especially on their or their friends’ smartphones ( TikTok , anyone?). While it’s true that there are many parent-control apps that filter and manage kids’ usage of smartphones, kids are smart, digital natives; they enjoy the challenge of coming up with new ways to bypass these measures . This can lead to an endless cat-and-mouse game of new measures and new workarounds.\n",
            "[Doc 576]: Back in the day, for parents to contact their children at school, they would have to call the school secretary, dictate a note and have it passed to the teacher and then to the student. Such inefficient methods are no longer required; direct content allows students and parents increased flexibility and freedom in their after-school playdates, activities, and pick-up arrangements. Plus, given the record number of school shootings occurring across America, smartphones give both students and their parents an added feeling of security, knowing that they can call and text each other at any moment.\n",
            "[Doc 3395]: REPLY: You are totally wrong about that. We at least progress the best when we do what we do in life voluntarily. School is abysmal and if it should exist at all it should be optional. That would make people a lot happier. It's an abomination to dogmatically make young people go to school for no reason let alone hit them! Only disgusting adults who have personal problems would hit children and coerce them into doing things they don't want to do. So-called \"education\" is a hollow word used as a smokescreen to con people. School is enforced because of scum that desire to oppress their fellow human being and because they know there's no real reason to go to school so the only way to make people go is by coercing them. Using coercion on people is a abominable. Especially on vulnerable and defenseless young people. School is not responsible for your 4th point so you can't say that. And I definitely don't think that school has bettered us. Something so totally oppressive and demeaning cannot be helpful. I am utterly NOT grateful for school and you can be dead sure of that. It only served to leave me with emotional wounds. Looking back on it I can say that if I'd had the choice I would have certainly said no to it. And we learn the most when away from school. There are people who think the same as me on this matter. We need to respect people's right to say no to school. School is a big spurious lie and being introduced to it at age 5 is a horrifying experience. I'm wondering just how many hints people need to realise that school's a bad thing.\n",

            "[Doc 3922]: If the school hours are extended, adults wouldn't have to pay for after-school care for as long as they would now. Also, they would be able to work longer hours thus getting more money, and making life more of a luxury. For instance, lets say that you finish school at 3pm. Your parents might put you in after-school care from 3pm-5pm, until they can pick you up. After-school care, in my case, is $50 per hour. Are parents willing to pay this price? If we extend school hours to 5pm, they won't have to put you in after-school care saving about $500 per week. Also, adults could work for longer and pick you up at about quarter-past 5-5:30, as you are allowed to stay after school is over for an amount of time. If we make school longer, this will save money, get adults more and make your life more luxurious.\n",

            "[Doc 2661]: Parents pay taxes for education and should be able to use those tax dollars to educate their children however and at whichever school they want. Chuck Weisenbach, Principal of Roncalli High, a private high school in Indianapolis, stated. \"It is not the government's responsibility to tell me where to educate my children… That's not only my right, it's my duty. And I shouldn't have the government telling me based on some random, geographic location that I have to go to this public high school.\" Vouchers also allow parents to choose a school that best fits a child's religious, cultural, or racial background, allowing that child to perform better in school, at home, and in his/her community.\n",
            "[Doc 2274]: One way we learn is by repetition, another is by doing things, when doing homework we learn in both of these ways. When we are taught a method at school, such as how to do a type of sum, then we need to practice using that method to make sure we know how to so that we can remember it. If we just learn the method and don’t practice it we will soon forget how we do it.\n",
            "[Doc 1992]: Schools are educational establishments that parents trust to protect and educate their children. Teachers and school administrators are those who should be keeping a watchful eye on the students in their care and intervene before harm comes to them. If bullying occurs at school, then that school has failed in its duties. In fact, in cases where suicides occurred, it has often later come to light that a bullying culture was widely tolerated at the school, and that school staff that knew about it did nothing to prevent it, with tragic results . To prosecute the bullies would shift responsibility from the woeful failure of the adults around them, who should have known better and done more than the children in their care.\n",
            "[Doc 2262]: Making sure that everyone gets the same amount of time at school promotes equality. At the moment leaving school early is linked to economic and social disadvantage: those from poorer areas and families are more likely to leave school early than those from wealthier families. Parents who left school at a young age are also more likely to have children who leave school early (only 60% of those children stay in education past 16) . Forcing all children to stay in school longer will help break this cycle of disadvantage.\n",
            "[Doc 2293]: Ensuring everyone gets educated for the same amount of time at school should promote equality. Currently early-school leaving is linked with other indicators of socio-economic disadvantage, such as low-income jobs or high unemployment. More importantly parents who left school young and as a consequence have lower-grade occupations are more likely to have children who leave school early (only 60% of those children stay in education past 16) . Forcing all children to stay in school longer could break this cycle of disadvantage.\n",
            "[Doc 3418]: i think that people have situations where they need to drop out of high school because of personal matters or maybe they have something else they want to pursue. I think that these people should definitely be allowed to dropout of high school. However i do think that those kids that just dropout because they are lazy and dont want to work but dont want to go to summer school. They just want to dropout to not put up with the hassle of school. Those people should stay in school. They are obviously going to not do any better outside of school, in fact some will do worse. So i think we should give them a chance to turn around and change and save themselves so they wont regret it. So i propose that we have the guidance counsler determine the dropouts along with the principal and the candidate that wants to dropout must have a valid reason and a bunch of back up points to their reason, therefore only the people that need or really want the dropout get it and not just all the lazy kids in high school.\n",
            "[Doc 3196]: If the school respects the Sikh customs, they must respect the customs of the school. School rules aren't arbitrary laws, they are there to protect children, to make a school an effective learning environment and to symbolise the school as an institution, a place of learning, a highly important part of life and a significant place in a local community. Therefore, the two must understand each other's equal importance and make a compromise.\n",
            "[Doc 2263]: Being in school does not guarantee that a student is actually learning. If the student lacks interest or ability then the extra time spent in school is unlikely to benefit them, especially if they would not have chosen to be there. This applies even more to the problem of how to deal with those who are disruptive. If they are excluded from school then they are disadvantaged for a longer period of their life. However, if they are included then they continue to disrupt the learning of other students. As Henry Phibbs argues: “Increasing the school leaving age will not result in more being learned – just more broken windows in the locality of the school. Children fed up with school need an escape route, not an extension of their sentence.\"\n",
            "[Doc 2246]: Having to wear smart clothes encourages children to respect their school and their teachers and behave themselves. This is because of the association between smart clothes and work. Casual wear at school can also make students feel over-relaxed and 'at home,' meaning they don't focus as much on work. A lot of schools are bringing back school uniform because they want to improve discipline. Moreover, school uniform can actively encourage students to enter into an adversarial relationship with the curriculum and their teachers. Exercising arbitrary control over children in the interests of “discipline” is likely to convince them that the very sensible, rational principles of learning and critical thought that they acquire during the school day are equally arbitrary and meaningless. By refusing to allow children to participate in enjoyable, beguiling processes of discovery and understanding unless they comply with unjustified and meaningless rules about dress, schools risk being seen as oppressive and capricious by their students. School uniforms return in drive to improve school discipline 1 October.\n",

The survey found that 96.68 percent of public schools have some sort of cellphone policy. Among them are differences in smartphone policies by school characteristics, such as whether policies at public charter schools or private schools, for example, differ from those at traditional public schools; what associations exist between the policies and student mental health; and how schools enforce cellphone policies.\n",

I think this is a very good site it has showed me why school bans cell phones it makes sense but I think they need to allow student to have them if they get caught on it they teacher takes it away but its still in the classroom and when they leave for next period they give it to the teacher so the kid does not get it back until when school gets out I can understand why parents are worried about there kids but parents need to calm down and let the school do its job.\n",

I think that these people should definitely be allowed to dropout of high school. However i do think that those kids that just dropout because they are lazy and dont want to work but dont want to go to summer school. They just want to dropout to not put up with the hassle of school. Those people should stay in school. They are obviously going to not do any better outside of school, in fact some will do worse. So i think we should give them a chance to turn around and change and save themselves so they wont regret it. So i propose that we have the guidance counsler determine the dropouts along with the principal and the candidate that wants to dropout must have a valid reason and a bunch of back up points to their reason, therefore only the people that need or really want the dropout get it and not just all the lazy kids in high school.\n",

If you have the chance to get a degree, take it; it can help you advance in life. Perhaps education should be a basic right, but unfortunately, the dire lack of schooling for people around the globe paints a very different picture. For millions, primary education isn’t even an option , let alone higher education. In fact, around 60 million children across the world are prevented from going to elementary school each day, which cancels their possibility of attending college. There are many people worldwide who die never having turned the page of a book.

And I shouldn't have the government telling me based on some random, geographic location that I have to go to this public high school.\" Vouchers also allow parents to choose a school that best fits a child's religious, cultural, or racial background, allowing that child to perform better in school, at home, and in his/her community.\n",

Also, they would be able to work longer hours thus getting more money, and making life more of a luxury. For instance, lets say that you finish school at 3pm. Your parents might put you in after-school care from 3pm-5pm, until they can pick you up. After-school care, in my case, is $50 per hour. Are parents willing to pay this price? If we extend school hours to 5pm, they won't have to put you in after-school care saving about $500 per week. Also, adults could work for longer and pick you up at about quarter-past 5-5:30, as you are allowed to stay after school is over for an amount of time. If we make school longer, this will save money, get adults more and make your life more luxurious.\n",

School is abysmal and if it should exist at all it should be optional. That would make people a lot happier. It's an abomination to dogmatically make young people go to school for no reason let alone hit them! Only disgusting adults who have personal problems would hit children and coerce them into doing things they don't want to do. So-called \"education\" is a hollow word used as a smokescreen to con people. School is enforced because of scum that desire to oppress their fellow human being and because they know there's no real reason to go to school so the only way to make people go is by coercing them. Using coercion on people is a abominable. Especially on vulnerable and defenseless young people. School is not responsible for your 4th point so you can't say that. And I definitely don't think that school has bettered us. Something so totally oppressive and demeaning cannot be helpful. I am utterly NOT grateful for school and you can be dead sure of that. It only served to leave me with emotional wounds. Looking back on it I can say that if I'd had the choice I would have certainly said no to it. And we learn the most when away from school. There are people who think the same as me on this matter. We need to respect people's right to say no to school.

Many careers these days are extremely competitive (for example careers in medicine and law) and even after achieving a high degree in a certain subject, it can prove extremely difficult to secure a career within that profession.

            "[Doc 2777]: I think that iPod's should not be allowed in school to some degree because it gets distracting at times, and people can be playing games and be on the internet instead of listening to the teacher and learning at school. There is a purpose to school, and if you decide to just sit there and play games all day then you will not learn anything, and your grades might start dropping. I think that people should be allowed to be using their iPod's and electronic devices when it is recess time because that is the time when you are free to do anything you want. if people want to spend their recess on there iPod's when it is their free time, I think that, that is totally fair. I think that any other time during school hours is not ok, because if a person is talking and you are sitting in your seat with your iPod, then you might get it taken away, but it is also being disrespectful to the person that is talking, because you are not giving them your attention and being a respectful listener. you can download games and apps prior to going to school and use them while connected to school wifi or not\n",

If the student lacks interest or ability then the extra time spent in school is unlikely to benefit them, especially if they would not have chosen to be there. This applies even more to the problem of how to deal with those who are disruptive. If they are excluded from school then they are disadvantaged for a longer period of their life. However, if they are included then they continue to disrupt the learning of other students. As Henry Phibbs argues: “Increasing the school leaving age will not result in more being learned – just more broken windows in the locality of the school.

            "[Doc 380]: Even in Muslim majority countries, many view the burqa as unwelcome encroachment of Saudi-brand, ultra-conservative Islam. Morocco’s government officially cited security concerns as the reason for its 2017 ban on the sale and manufacture of the burqa (terrorists have used the burqa to hide bombs and other weapons). However, the pretext of deterring the integration of Salafist versions of Islam into Moroccan society is certainly present. In Egypt , where religious scholars and public officials have contested the necessity to cover the face in the name of modesty, universities and hospitals have banned the niqab, and the government has mulled over banning them in public spaces entirely. Controversies surrounding full-face veils in the Muslim world underscore their complex social, religious, and political implications – implications that dictate a need to regulate their use in the public sphere.\n",
            "[Doc 27]: While anti-Muslim hate crimes have dropped in recent years in ten of America’s largest cities, Columnist Sabria Jawhar argued in the past that in light of Islamophobic incidents in general the necessity for safety overrides the necessity to dress according to one’s cultural mores. Jawhar noted that rather than fulfilling its purpose to repel attention from Muslim women, in the West, the burqa and niqab produce the opposite effect – attracting unwanted attention and in many cases, harassment or violence , which has become more and more normalized on social media. Official burqa bans could help women who might be ambivalent about removing their burqas make a decision that will better ensure their safety. Those who protest that the victims of bad behavior should not be the ones to make concessions will kindly remember that the burqa itself is intended to help women ward off lascivious male gazes.\n",
            "[Doc 1223]: Wearing a burqa is no more harmful than wearing a Marilynn Manson shirt. Sure, it might make some people uncomfortable, but it does nothing to threaten the safety, liberty, or freedom of any other individual. If anything, today in the middle of the pandemic, those women wearing a burqa may actually blend in , given that no one else’s full face should be uncovered out in public. Furthermore, women in the West who wear burqas are a minority within a minority – Muslims in the US constitute less than 1.1 percent of the total population. As such, no legislation is required to protect onlookers from a piece of cloth most Americans are unlikely to be confronted with in the first place.\n",
            "[Doc 3289]: It's just not viable. If you ban something as sacred and religious as the veil, you're going to get people then issuing rallying cries for other things to be banned. At the end of the day if the Government feel that it is in the best interests not to ban the veil, then we have to believe them. If anything happen, it is the blood being spilt on their hands, but while this is not occurring, then there should be no reason to attempt to ban it.\n",
            "[Doc 1781]: Aside from the fact that handguns are uniquely dangerous weapons, when the handgun ban was in place in DC, there was a reported decrease in crime in the area. In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.\n",
            "[Doc 2880]: Why should the army be allowed to market themselves to children who are too young to buy alcohol, cigarettes or drive when joining the army is more dangerous than these three things? If we protect our children from the harmful effects of drugs, we should be protecting them from getting shot as well. Allowing one and not the other is hypocrisy - and since letting 16 year olds drink legally would be a less-than-sensible idea, we should ban the armed forces from recruiting in schools.\n",
            "[Doc 2187]: A trans-fat ban would hurt small restaurants the most. Carlie Irwin argues: “Since most of the big chains have already started the process of eliminating trans-fat from their food, the ban would be no big deal to them. But small, independent restaurants are another story. The potential ban has small restaurant owners sweating and nervously eyeing their deep fryers. As the St. Louis Business Journal points out, many small restaurant owners don’t have the ability to effectively and efficiently reformulate their menu items. So banning trans fat could mean that your favorite independently-owned fried chicken joint down the street will be shuttering its doors.”(17) Consequently, a trans-fat ban would breed legal exceptions and inconsistencies. For example, in Illinois bakeries were exempted from their ban because lawmakers knew that it would drive up their costs and hurt the bakeries specialty items. Many other small businesses would be similarly affected Restaurants and other specialty vendors who use trans-fat products on site would also be affected. Lawmakers then have a choice of either reducing the effect of the ban and including lots of bureaucratic exemptions or punishing these businesses.\n",
            "[Doc 3534]: Whilst it is true that some cannot afford to give thier children a private education this should not mean that the institutions should be abolished completely! This is equivalent to arguing that as some cannot afford Ferraris they should cease production. Of course there will always be inequality but this does not mean we should ban a good service for some on the basis that it is not available to all. Yes, perhaps we should try to make it more accesible through scholarships and bursaries etc, and perhaps one day it will be available for all, but until then it would be a step backwards to abolish private education. Communism didn't work people!\n",
            "[Doc 1242]: A ban or high restrictions is a good measure to diminish the effects of smoking in society, because unlike the spreading of information (which is usually done by schools / clubs), governmental restrictions or a total ban will ensure the access of measures to the whole population. Through a ban on advertisement or higher taxation those citizens not involved in active educational structures get educated about the problem. Studies on the ban of advertisements show that bans actually contribute great amounts to the reduction of smokers. \"The tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug,\" said Dr Douglas Bettcher, Director of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. \"But comprehensive advertising bans do work, reducing tobacco consumption by up to 16% in countries that have already taken this legislative step. \"1 So because these measures can drastically decrease smoking when other measures have failed, the state is right to impose bans on advertisement, higher prices or any other measures.\n",
            "[Doc 3577]: Using cars at CBD demonstrates the rational irrationality that ultimately undermines the interests of every \"rational\" individual. \"Driving cars could be fast, and therefore I should drive a car.\" This is the rationale for an individual. And it surely makes sense. But when millions of people in town all think the same and consequently acting the same, we get problems. Cars are everywhere, making driving a short distance take a long long time: people get stuck in cars, wasting fuels, polluting the environment (for just for waiting!). No body can travel around at all. Yes, we love to realize people's full liberty's to drive cars and listen to car radios, but that liberty comes with a cost, a cost too big for the society to function, a cost that severely undermines everybody's liberty in this regard. Because when people adheres perfect rationally to their preference, sometime they also act without regard to the irrationality of the decisions cost-benefit analysis in the bigger picture. And the total traffic turmoil is the bigger picture that people forget to take into account. As a result, no one wins. No one get to effectively move at all. Sometimes we need to limit some freedom in order to people to enjoy more freedom in the same way we ban hate speech, we ban racially discriminatory contents. In order for every one to be able to MOVE in CBD, we ban cars here.\n",

It is something we as human's are designed to eat, we are Apex predators , top of the food chain, we are built to hunt and consume other animals. The arguments that meat is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly do not mean that we should not eat meat, it simply means that we should not eat as much. We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was. I do not believe that this was an immoral way of living, it is not about wether we shoudl eat meat it is about how we currently eat meat. We need to have an awarness of environmental harm and look at reducing it, we need to aknowledge animal cruelty and stop it, we need to farm and prodice efficiently but we do not need to stop eating meat.\n",
            "[Doc 2274]: One way we learn is by repetition, another is by doing things, when doing homework we learn in both of these ways. When we are taught a method at school, such as how to do a type of sum, then we need to practice using that method to make sure we know how to so that we can remember it.

            "[Doc 3371]: Imposing an age restriction for instance would be impossible to police. Only a full ban would be able to protect children from music that glorifies crime. We would never dream of only placing a partial ban on inciting racism for instance, because we know it is incorrect in any situation to glorify racism. Isn't murder, rape and theft equal if not more vile than racism? The prospect that anybody, regardless of age, could be influenced to commit such atrocities is morally reprehensible.\n",
            "[Doc 3658]: There are many things we consume but can’t be measured, healthcare, national defence and education, for example. How do we decide how much everyone should pay for them? To answer just one of the points raised, the childless should pay for other people's children to be educated because education does not just benefit the individual - the benefits a literate worker brings to the economy are such that everyone benefits. A direct tax is fair and progressive, because it demonstrates that we all have equal responsibility for the welfare of others. We live in a state where we believe in helping each other, rather than being selfish and helping only ourselves. That is why we have free public transport for the over-60s and the disabled, that's why we have state education, and why we formed the NHS sixty years ago. None of these would be possible without direct taxation.\n",
            "[Doc 2177]: Thomas Jefferson said “the purpose of government is to enable the people of a nation to live in safety and happiness”. In Bloomberg’s case it was among his campaign promises “To achieve the biggest public health gains in the nation” and given his record with the smoking ban this kind of proposal is the obvious way to achieve such a goal. The ban on large sodas does not prohibit the consumption of soda, it simply impedes negative choices for poor nutrition.\n",
            "[Doc 591]: Banning symbols associated with extremism does not necessarily combat extremism. In Australia , there have been different bills introduced over the years to ban women from wearing the burqa in public. However, its national security agency, ASIO, concluded that the measure would only fuel radicalization campaigns and further isolate vulnerable populations. The ASIO’s conclusions have already been brought to bear in Asia: the USSR’s studious repression of Islam in Central Asia in the twentieth century gave way to Islamic revivalism that turned to radicalism in the twenty-first century, with groups like the Taliban and ISIS gaining influence in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Similarly, China’s restrictions against public expressions of Islam like growing a beard or wearing a veil has been a significant catalyst for unrest in the country’s predominantly Muslim Xinjiang region.\n",
            "[Doc 3067]: It allows you to vent your anger without actually harming anyone. It is an honest, down-to-earth expression of how you feel. Many 'swear words' are the original words for things before being replaced by a loan word and actually less harmful in literal meaning. To ban swearing would make society more formal and make it less comfortable to be in - we need to ban swearing on TV or films made for very young children, but it would be stifling to apply the same rules to everyday life.\n",
            "[Doc 2200]: Although it might be very tempting for the government to try and attack the problem of childhood obesity by attempting to change, in essence, the very choices our kids can make, this is the wrong way of going about doing it. The purpose of schools is education – the genesis of active and useful members of society. A large extent of what schools do is imprinting the ideas the society values. In most western countries those would be the ideas of fairness, democracy, freedom of expression, etc. The other side of the coin is the transference of knowledge, knowledge of mathematics, history, but also of biology, health and nutrition. We see thus that the proposed ban on specific choices one makes in school, whether be it choices regarding food or choices regarding the clothes one wears, the ideas one expresses, and so on, is truly meaningless in the existing concept of education. What the schools should be doing is putting more emphasis on getting the message of the importance of a healthy lifestyle across. Our kids should be taught that this lifestyle consists of more than just whether or not we chose to eat a hamburger and fries for lunch. In short, this ban falls short of truly educating the children about how important physical activity, balanced meals and indulging in moderation are. They should also focus on the importance of choice, since in the case of childhood obesity, making the right nutritional and lifestyle choices is of paramount importance. But they should also focus on the importance of choice for a society and how all should take responsibility for their choices in such a society.\n",
            "[Doc 2062]: The state stepping in to block smoking in films is arguably a step too far into infringing freedom of expression, while smoking is bad this does not mean the state should feel the need to completely protect us as a society from it. Highlighting health issues is acceptable but we cannot be protected from everything. The government should not be trying to ban smoking in films when it is such a small issue in the grand scheme of things, especially when there are other more important issues in the world that need tackling. One of the Government’s main roles in society should be to keep the country running and not to micro-manage it, as individuals we should be able to make our own decisions to both be able to deconstruct the use of smoking within a film and to secondly be able to make the choice as to whether to smoke or not for as long as the product is legal.\n",

Just as a lion can kill antelope and a frog can kill insects, so too human beings have struggled their way to the top of the food chain. Why then can we not exercise the power we have earned? Animals exercise their power and we should do the same. It is our natural obligation to do so. The reason we have always killed animals is because we need them. We need meat to be healthy and we need to test medicines on animals to protect our own race. We use animals to further our own race. This too is surely a natural obligation.\n",

            "[Doc 1151]: Marie Kondo writes that “ when we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volume and therefore can never finish.” As such, her philosophy declares that decluttering your space must be done comprehensively and all at once . This way, objective results can be obtained, driving future upkeep. Otherwise, the tidying process would never be completed . This, in turn, creates a sense that the work is never-ending, which can lead to a subsequent lack of motivation. Sometimes, people need a new approach to tidying up to drive real change. Though extremely intensive, the KonMari Method may help accomplish this task as it forces you to transform your space quickly.\n",
            "[Doc 699]: People tend to ascribe more value to items, simply because they own(ed) them. Adhering to Kondo’s philosophy, asking yourself “ What sparks joy ?” acknowledges your belongings’ usefulness. It also teaches you to show gratitude to those objects that bring you joy, which, in turn, provides insight into what you value, which will help decide what to keep. This method takes the form of physical and mental decluttering , giving you a greater appreciation for everything you have in life. It can also influence future life choices, purchasing patterns and can enable you to acquire only what you need from a place of greater clarity. The KonMari Method has the potential to prevent physical and psychological clutter from resurfacing later by teaching you what you truly value.\n",

If we just learn the method and don’t practice it we will soon forget how we do it.\n",
            "[Doc 53]: For many, there is no such thing as a singular decluttering project, after which clutter never resurfaces. Yet, this is a tenet of the KonMari Method. People buy new items, store them inappropriately, forget purchases, regret purchases and launch new decluttering operations. It’s human nature. The concept that people tidy once and never have to tidy again, even after acquiring new belongings, is unrealistic for most people. Such a philosophy expects too much of people; such a commitment to the process of tidying up takes energy and time; if it is abandoned halfway through or left unfinished, it may leave people feeling worse about themselves and their home than when they started.\n",
            "[Doc 581]: Marie Kondo wrote her guide as a single woman in her early thirties, living in a small Japanese apartment. As such, American readers should consider that Japanese men and women living in micro apartments with inadequate storage space may mull acquisitions more than the average American. This could also mean that the KonMari Method would be more effective for people living in Japan than for people living in America. Therefore, people living in large spaces or with many family members and/or roommates, such as families with multiple children , may not realistically benefit from her decluttering philosophy. Tidying an entire home in one go or sorting through the belongings of six family members according to category may end up being confusing and ineffective.\n",

This direction of evolution will lead to an involution that is not desirable and should not be accepted! This remote killing technology was first used for spying but then it started to be used for killing. And this happened because of the declining recruitment levels and a population less ready to risk death in combat. But this desire to stop risking their lives in combats should force sides to find more democratic ways to solve the conflicts, not to find more convenient ways to depersonalise killing and kill with impunity!\n",

            "[Doc 1885]: The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1. In short, the death penalty can- and does- save the lives of innocent people. \"The Death Penalty Deters Crime and Saves Lives,\" August 28,2007.

            "[Doc 1969]: Almost all terrorist groups kill people, whether innocents or members of the military. Even those who limit casualties by giving warnings of their atrocities are unperturbed when they do end up taking lives. Negotiation can then be the best way to save lives both in the short and long term. In the short term negotiating can mean a cease fire, and if there are hostages their release. Over the long term negotiation is necessary if there is to be any peaceful conclusion to the conflict. As the right to life is the most fundamental right, and the duty of the states to protect its citizens is primary role of the state it is clear that the protection of these lives should be the main consideration for the state.\n",

In some cases, this may truly be the motive. Case in point, punishing the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons against civilians. But rarely does military action improve the lives of ordinary citizens. The US mission in Libya was aimed at stopping a government-led massacre of its citizens. It may have done that, but Gaddafi’s death in 2011 led to civil war and chaos in the country, with ISIS gaining a foothold. Post-occupation Iraq looks no better, and Afghanistan remains at the mercy of the Taliban , more than 20 years after the 2001 US invasion.

No matter the opinions on these matters, they always promote prevention, maybe it can seem obsesive and repetitive... but what if you only have access to traditional media on a determined hour of a day? can the governments truly take on the task of informing all of its population of such things? can they have similar reach?

Unlike traditional organising techniques emphasising systematic sorting and storage ... What is the KonMari method? Though extremely intensive, the KonMari Method may help accomplish this task as it forces you to transform your space quickly. People tend to ascribe more value to items, simply because they own (ed) them. Adhering to Kondo’s philosophy, asking yourself “ What sparks joy?” acknowledges your belongings’ usefulness. Does Kondo's KonMari method affect your life? The KonMari method may seem strict and unyielding to you. In some ways, it is. However, those who follow Kondo’s way of organizing believe that it has a significant impact on not just their homes, but also their personal lives. Did Marie Kondo learn the KonMari method? Marie Kondo is also a wife and mother. And yes, her children learned the KonMari method for beginners starting at very young ages. Kondo may have many influences for her method, but her background of working part-time at a Shinto shrine when she was a teenager has been part of her influence. How to organize a house using the KonMari method? To organize a house using the KonMari method, we usually start by tackling categories of items, like sweaters or shoes or papers, not spaces, like bedrooms or hallways closets, etc. We often have items of the same category stored throughout our house in different places.

            "[100/185] Summarizing: Should We Legalize Marijuana?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 378]: Just like smoking cigarettes, smoking pot contributes to the development of respiratory diseases and increased risk to lung health. In addition, doctors and health officials assert that there is a direct connection between marijuana use and psychosis and schizophrenia . With the legalization of marijuana use, the prevalence of marijuana-related illnesses may grow with the number of people who use it. For example, following legalization, Colorado health professionals noted a surge in cases of extreme illness in children who ingested marijuana edibles (it is no help that many such edibles look exactly like gummy bears). Law enforcement, too, has complained of the difficulty of identifying drugged drivers , whose level of intoxication cannot be easily verified as with alcohol. In addition, research suggests that drivers under the influence of marijuana are 1.65 times more likely to be responsible for fatal accidents.\n",
            "[Doc 757]: Somewhat counterintuitively, one of the more effective ways to discourage drug use is to legalize it. When Portugal decriminalized all drugs, the country’s drug abuse rates were cut in half and there was no increase in use of weed or any other substance. Still today, rates of drug use in the country remain below the EU average . Other drug-tolerant nations, like the Netherlands, show significantly lower rates of lifetime and occasional marijuana use. One year after Colorado legalized recreational pot use for adults, a survey of 17,000 high school students showed a decline in teen marijuana use. The rate is still on the downswing even as of 2021. It seems marijuana legalization may have stripped the drug of its rebellious appeal and returned Colorado teens to other means of weekend thrills.\n",
            "[Doc 1117]: Throughout America, municipalities that support decriminalization (legalization’s half-sister) policies, have saved money on drug enforcement. For instance, sources estimate that state and local governments spend around $29 billion on marijuana prohibition annually, with an additional $18 billion spent by the federal government. Meanwhile, full marijuana legalization would bring in $19 billion in state and local tax revenue and $39 billion in federal tax revenue. Clearly, the legalization of marijuana can cut government spending. This consequently saves resources for other societal uses (like finding a new approach to dealing with the country’s ongoing opioid crisis ). Not to mention, the legalization of marijuana can generate tax revenue that could go towards transferring income from drug producers and consumers to public funds.\n",
            "[Doc 574]: The global legal marijuana market size is estimated to reach $102.2 billion by the end of 2030, according to a Grand View Research, Inc . report. If that’s not telling enough, a study conducted by the Marijuana Policy Group concluded that Colorado’s legalized pot industry created 18,000 jobs and generated over $2 billion in economic activity in 2015. Since then, the marijuana industry has boosted a number of business sectors , from agriculture to materials to transportation. Even more so, the industry has brought US veterans back to work, through security positions on farms and in dispensaries. In an economy where workers regularly lose jobs to overseas operations and automation, governments cannot afford to turn their backs on industries that create new opportunities for their citizens to earn a decent living.\n",
            "[Doc 1937]: The free market views the human body and the human mind as a mere instrument: the only value an individual being has is the value it can sell its labour (whether it be manual or mental work) for on the market. Workers don’t work because they want to produce something they themselves find inherently valuable; they work to earn a living. And given that most people are not entrepreneurs or business owners, this means that most people will spend the most of their waking day labouring for goals set to them by others, in partial processes subdivided and defined for them by others, all to create products and services which are only valuable to others, not to themselves ( Alienation,  1977). This commodification of the human body and mind can go so far that humans actually start selling themselves: free market proponents propose to legalize the selling of one’s own organs. When humans start selling themselves, they perceive no value in themselves anymore – all they see in themselves is an instrument to satisfy other people’s desires, a product to be packaged and sold. This becomes even more pronounced when we take into account that the free market exacerbates inequality: if someone is born into a poor family and can’t get out of it, it might seem the only way to get out of it, is to sell oneself. Thus, the proposal to legalize the selling of one’s own organs amounts to an ‘unconscionable choice’: a choice which is, given the circumstances, unreasonable to ask of someone.\n",
            "[Doc 3990]: Meat is not inherently wrong. It is something we as human's are designed to eat, we are Apex predators , top of the food chain, we are built to hunt and consume other animals. The arguments that meat is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly do not mean that we should not eat meat, it simply means that we should not eat as much. We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was. I do not believe that this was an immoral way of living, it is not about wether we shoudl eat meat it is about how we currently eat meat. We need to have an awarness of environmental harm and look at reducing it, we need to aknowledge animal cruelty and stop it, we need to farm and prodice efficiently but we do not need to stop eating meat.\n",
            "[Doc 2274]: One way we learn is by repetition, another is by doing things, when doing homework we learn in both of these ways. When we are taught a method at school, such as how to do a type of sum, then we need to practice using that method to make sure we know how to so that we can remember it. If we just learn the method and don’t practice it we will soon forget how we do it.\n",
            "[Doc 4033]: If we are mature and can make our own life decisions on our own, we should be considered legal.\n",
            "[Doc 3658]: There are many things we consume but can’t be measured, healthcare, national defence and education, for example. How do we decide how much everyone should pay for them? To answer just one of the points raised, the childless should pay for other people's children to be educated because education does not just benefit the individual - the benefits a literate worker brings to the economy are such that everyone benefits. A direct tax is fair and progressive, because it demonstrates that we all have equal responsibility for the welfare of others. We live in a state where we believe in helping each other, rather than being selfish and helping only ourselves. That is why we have free public transport for the over-60s and the disabled, that's why we have state education, and why we formed the NHS sixty years ago. None of these would be possible without direct taxation.\n",
            "[Doc 1249]: We have always been superior to animals. Just as a lion can kill antelope and a frog can kill insects, so too human beings have struggled their way to the top of the food chain. Why then can we not exercise the power we have earned? Animals exercise their power and we should do the same. It is our natural obligation to do so. The reason we have always killed animals is because we need them. We need meat to be healthy and we need to test medicines on animals to protect our own race. We use animals to further our own race. This too is surely a natural obligation.\n",
            "[Doc 1282]: The use of performance enhancing drugs is based on advances in science. When new drugs and therapies are found, athletes turn to them and as a result are much of the time ahead of the anti-doping organizations, which need to develop methods of athlete testing whenever a new drug that is meant to be untraceable is created. In 2008 it was a big shock when Riccardo Ricco (a cyclist) was caught using the performance-enhancing drug Mircera, which had been considered undetectable for a number of years. The fact is that a ban of performance enhancing drugs enables mainly athletes from wealthy countries and teams that can afford the newest technology to go undetected, whilst others are disadvantaged (1). So because it gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy one who can pay for the undetectable drugs, we should legalize it.\n",
            "[Doc 2846]: just because we are sixteen does not mean that we dont have an opinion why do not get to say what we want to say and why do we have any less value than adults.\n",
            "[Doc 3700]: They hold a privileged position in society as we need to protect them. Childhood is about having fun and we should promote that rather than putting responsibility onto children as to voting. Statistics show that children these days do suffer from feeling too pressured from school work , we should not add to this by allowing them to vote.\n",
            "[Doc 4032]: \"All men are created equal...\" this should count for laws too. We are just the same as any other person, the only difference is we are younger.\n",
            "[Doc 3518]: Education of this higher level should be seen as investment, not just of time but also of money. A person who gets a University education can expect to earn more in their life time than someone with just A levels. If we stopped making excuses and put the effort in, we could all afford to go to university, even if we did have to take out personal loans and credit cards. We just have to acknowledge that the three years of living on the breadline is worth it for the future profits that the degree shall reap. Such an investment is not one that the government should have to make on our behalf. It is for our benefit, therefore we should stump the costs. The amount of students leaving university and struggling to get a graduate level job is increasing, therefore why should the government fund free university education when the amount of jobs for graduates are running low?\n",
            "[Doc 2817]: Whilst I personally disagree with the idea that babies should have their ears pierced I am also fed up with a nanny state that sees fit to legislate all areas of our life. If we want parents to not do this we should convince them through reason and argument. If we can't convince them, and clearly we will never be able to convince everyone, so be it. Part of living in a society is accepting people will choose to do things we may think wrong. Provided the things they do don't harm others then they state has no place controlling their actions.\n",
            "[Doc 3059]: This debate is trying to point our attention to the fact that animals are not all that different from humans and that we should not presume that they have no sense of privacy. However, should we not take into account how an animal uses it's own privacy? If you look at how humans give birth, it is behind curtains. Often the family will not be in the room only the father of the child and he necessary doctors. If you look at how humans mate, it is confined to the bedroom. If you look to how we go to the toilet in times where we have choice, we go behind closed doors. Now, look at animals, animals do not hide, they show no shame. They mate in the open, they release their waste in the open and they give birth in the open. Given that this is how they treat their own privacy, why should we think that they value it? If they do not value their own privacy, why should we value it?\n",
            "[Doc 1928]: Suicide is a waste of life. It is an immoral act that ignores the sacrosanct nature of human life – something that is universally considered to be the case as shown by being something nearly all religions consider to be the case. Nowadays we hear everyone talking about human rights; we hear precious little about human obligations. If we believe in the moral worth of human rights we do so because we think that human life is a wonderful thing and something with which we should not interfere. Whether the interference is by others or by ourselves, any action that denigrates human life is morally wrong for precisely the reason that we support human rights. We have an obligation to preserve all life, including our own.\n",
            "[Doc 3970]: It is also suggested that all our thoughts are in our native language, hence, we can’t understand things we don’t have words for, as we physically can’t think of concepts we don’t have words for.\n",
            "[Doc 2880]: Why should the army be allowed to market themselves to children who are too young to buy alcohol, cigarettes or drive when joining the army is more dangerous than these three things? If we protect our children from the harmful effects of drugs, we should be protecting them from getting shot as well. Allowing one and not the other is hypocrisy - and since letting 16 year olds drink legally would be a less-than-sensible idea, we should ban the armed forces from recruiting in schools.\n",

In states where marijuana used is fully or partially legal, the new cannabis industry can impact the local economy in a variety of ways. Washington and Colorado are the two states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational use the longest.

            "[101/185] Summarizing: Red Auerbach or Phil Jackson:  Who’s the best NBA coach ever?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1129]: Phil Jackson is the best of all time because he won an unequalled 11 NBA rings, six with the Chicago Bulls and three with the LA Lakers. He bested some tough opposition to achieve this, especially when compared to Auerbach, who played when the league was smaller and less competitive. Jackson has the highest winning percentage of any hall-of-famer or coach that oversaw 500 or more games. He won three ‘three-peats,’ meaning winning three championships in a row, even getting close to achieving a fourth one during his last season with the Lakers. Between 1991 and 2011, he went to a conference final 14 out of 20 times.\n",
            "[Doc 11]: Auerbach had a special eye for discovering rising stars and building a winning team out of them. He pushed hard for Bill Russell in the 1956 NBA draft, seeing huge potential in his defensive qualities. Russell became a key part in the team’s ability to stop opposition advances and then start their own counterattacks. Molding young players in the ways he saw fit, Auerbach offered a springboard to players like John Havlicek, who then became the engine behind many of the championships they won together. In 1978, it was Auerbach’s vision that drove the Celtics to draft Larry Bird, who was still relatively unknown. He turned out to be one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen. Auerbach’s negotiation skills were key here as they gave him an edge in getting the players he wanted.\n",
            "[Doc 506]: Beyond tactics, Auerbach transformed the NBA by accelerating its embrace of previously shunned black athletes. He drafted the first-ever black player, Chuck Cooper , in 1950. Fourteen years later, he sent out the first-ever all-black starting five. Auerbach was also the first to hire a black head coach in 1966, Bill Russell . He prioritized talent over skin color at a time when Jim Crow laws were still being applied in the US. Black players rewarded him with successes, playing a big part in the Boston Celtics’ eight-year championship run.\n",
            "[Doc 750]: Red Auerbach’s creative understanding of the game allowed him to revolutionize it tactically. His touch turned the flailing Boston Celtics into a real fighting force, the only team to ever win eight consecutive NBA championships. He valued defense over offense. By focusing on breaking up the opposition’s plays, his teams punished them with counterattacks. Auerbach emphasized teamwork, drilling his players to form a cohesive unit that dominated other teams all over the court. He also invented the sixth man, which is a tactic that entails having one of the stronger non-starting players come off the bench to make a bigger impact when the game is already in full-swing.\n",
            "[Doc 454]: Michael Jackson’s exploits are well-documented and bizarre, even by Hollywood’s standards. In the 80’s, his chimpanzee, Bubbles , was his constant companion. He built an amusement park in his backyard, had two spur-of-the moment marriages, and frequent changes in his appearance were ever-present in tabloid news. A former Jackson publicist alleged that Jackson’s antics were his version of wagging the dog – that Jackson leaked rumors about himself and behaved strangely to build celebrity through spectacle. Later, he tried to create marketing stunts like seeking knighthood from the late Queen of England to deflect bad press – namely, accusations of sexual abuse against children.\n",
            "[Doc 927]: When Kobe played, he had a better supportive team around him, both on the court and in the coach position. Three out of Kobe`s five rings were won together with Shaquille O’Neil , possibly the best center to ever play the game. Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, although none of them is a hall-of-famer, make a fantastic supportive team. Moreover, Kobe won his five rings with former coach Phil Jackson , who many argue is probably the sharpest basketball mind to ever exist. Meanwhile, LeBron won his first two rings as part of the Miami Heat`s trio. Aside from Dwayne Wade, LeBron’s supportive team lacked the quality that Kobe`s support had. LeBron won his championship third ring against a team that scored the best regular season record ever. LeBron won the finals’ MVP award and was the most dominant player in every championship he won. He might have fewer championship rings than Kobe had, but he played a bigger part in achieving them.\n",
            "[Doc 528]: Jackson controversies not related to molestation accusations were (and still are) a multi-million-dollar industry. Tabloids buzzed with “Wacko Jacko’s” sale-boosting antics. One tell-all author, the artist’s former publicist, admitted to writing an unofficial Jackson biography because he was broke . Headlines suggest that Jackson’s own family, mainly his siblings , were no strangers to attempts at taking advantage of him and his assets – in life and after his death. If such reports are true, and his own family saw the value in creating controversy to milk him for money, it’s easy to believe that so-called friends and certainly strangers looked at Jackson as a potential source of easy money.\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 961]: Long before the HBO documentary Leaving Neverland debuted at Sundance in 2018, a 2002 New York Times article traced Jackson’s fading star against the backdrop of his bizarre behavior and accusations of child molestation, correctly noting that while the public is tolerant of artists with addictions, they are intolerant of any form of child abuse. Although Jackson settled the 1993 accusations of sexual abuse out of court and was later acquitted of other accusations laid against him in 2003 , Michael’s bizarre and questionable behavior, namely, his unusual relationships with children, underpinned the public’s suspicions. In fact, a 2005 trial in a Gallup poll reported that most Americans believed that the charges leveled against Jackson were true. Public response has to Leaving Neverland continues the narrative, documenting the accounts of two men who claim that Jackson molested them as boys.\n",
            "[Doc 970]: Jackson was great at thinking of new ways to play basketball. He came up with the Triangle Offense, which Chuck Klosermann called “the single most dominant offensive attack of the past 20 years.” It entails a team forming a triangle with the post, wing and corner players. Being disciplined about staying in formation, switching positions and smart passing make it incredibly hard to defend against. The Triangle Offense became legendary because of its effectiveness and how hard it was to pull off. Others tried to imitate it, but none could coach it like Jackson did.\n",
            "[Doc 209]: Like it or not, NBA basketball is a game of super stars. Players have a substantial impact on the game, their team, and even on their team`s squads and managerial decisions. Their egos are huge, and rightfully so, because during the money time, it`s them out there; they take the shots, and they take the blame for missed shots. Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever. Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton are Hall of Famers who were THE superstars of the golden era. Until today, they are considered as one of the best in their positions. The 1984 draft had the biggest star quality ever and should be considered the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 1227]: Jackson gave millions in charity and was one of the first celebrities to establish his own charitable foundation. He used his star power to rally other performers to charity anthems like “Heal the World” and “ We Are the World ,” an iconic song emphasizing humanity that he co-wrote with Lionel Richie. Jackson’s commitment to social justice was a recurring theme in his music. By setting an example of giving and inspiring social consciousness with songs like “Man in the Mirror” and “They Don’t Really Care About Us,” Jackson popularized an ethos of harmony and shared responsibility.\n",
            "[Doc 70]: Coming into the league, Russell had an unsupportive environment . His coach, Lane Kiffin, didn’t want him picked, and once picked, his coach refused to work with him. Moreover, his team`s offense was unskilled, and the several good players that were part of the team were unavailable on a regular basis during Russell`s playing years. In contrast, Leaf had a solid team with a good coach when he entered the league. Unlike Russell, Leaf failed to make it on other teams, which is clear evidence that the main problem was Leaf himself.\n",
            "[Doc 1531]: Under this policy the victim is punished for the crimes of coach. This seems unfair, why should someone have their professional dream denied to them because somebody else did something wrong? Banning an entire nation from a sporting competition expands this, individuals with no or little attachment to cases of abuse will also be punished and suffer, when they have taken no steps that deserve punishment. Punishments should fit the crime and this means punishing those who are responsible not innocents. It is right that the punishment should be harsh as it needs to deter coaches but this deterrent should be through steep penalties for the coach not for others.\n",
            "[Doc 416]: Jackson revolutionized music videos and live performance. He pioneered a new era in music video, enchanting audiences with the Moonwalk , not to mention cinematic and special effects marvels like “ Thriller ,” “Black or White” and “Scream.” He even used magic to dazzle audiences on his multi-million-dollar tours. Jackson once said: “An artist’s imagination is his greatest tool. It can… transport you to a different place altogether.” To be sure, Jackson was a master of transporting his audiences to places they’d never imagined. This feat has been globally recognized; in fact, in 2018, London’s National Portrait Gallery opened an exhibit dedicated to the King of Pop’s artistry, displaying his legacy alongside the likes of other iconic artists like Andy Warhol and Frida Kahlo.\n",
            "[Doc 362]: Jackson won so much because he had the ability to help his players grow in ways that others couldn’t. A big part of this was mentality; he taught big egos, like Michael Jordan , to be more team-oriented. He also managed to convince great talents, like Scottie Pippen, to play second-fiddle to greater ones, like Jordan. Similarly, it was a huge achievement of his to get Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal to form such a deadly on-field partnership, given their many disagreements, which have their own wikipedia page . Jackson had a unique style of coaching, inspired by Zen Buddhism and earning him the nickname “the Zen Master.” Perhaps it was this mindfulness that allowed him to calm and manage hot tempers. Some of these men were molded by Jackson into the winners we know them as.\n",
            "[Doc 344]: The NBA draft is about predicting each player’s ability. Teams make selections according to a player`s potential and talent. The best draft should be the one with the most talented – not the most successful – players. The 1996 draft had the most talented players, including Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant , two of the most talented NBA players ever, and other huge talents like Steve Nash and Stephon Marbury. The 1984 draft didn’t have the most talented players. Hakeem, Barkley and John Stockton were superstars with huge careers, but mostly due to their characters and determination, not necessarily due to their talent. If you look at drafts by the amount of talent, it`s the 1996 that claims the top spot.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 817]: In terms of being a team player, there is no comparison between Kobe and LeBron. The latter is a smart player and fantastic passer , with a vision of a crafty point guard. He can create a shooting opportunity for himself in every position but will happily pass the ball if his teammate has a better shot. In contrast, Kobe was thought of by many as a selfish player , who hurt his team’s harmony, as was pointed out in the Phil Jackson biography . Kobe was ambitious but also arrogant in a way that led him to make bad on-court choices more than once. In contrast, LeBron’s teamwork and leadership shined after he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers, taking them to four playoffs in his first four years. His leadership skills have since gotten stronger since joining the LA Lakers in July 2018. Lifting up one’s team is the mark of a great player.\n",

            "[102/185] Summarizing: Is the NFL losing its appeal?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 603]: Though overshadowed by widespread negative coverage, the NFL’s national anthem protests have led to positive developments. At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice.\n",
            "[Doc 778]: Once considered a great unifier of American society, NFL football suddenly became a political and social divider in the summer of 2016. That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest. For many , NFL games – and post-game analyses – no longer provide an escape from draining politics but have turned into an unwelcome extension of it.\n",
            "[Doc 323]: Long before Colin Kaepernick took a knee, the NFL was dealing with another scandal involving a number of its players perpetrating domestic abuse . The latest headlines show the Patriots’ receiver, Antonio Brown being accused of multiple incidents of alleged sexual assault. He is by no means the only one . In the summer of 2014, after being accused of mishandling the infamous Ray Rice incident, in which the Baltimore Ravens player was caught on video beating his then-fiancé, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new league policy to punish any player involved in domestic violence or sexual assault with a six-game suspension without pay. However, it was inconsistently reinforced, and even updated in 2016 with more loopholes. Since then, the NFL appears to have softened its stance, enforcing the six-game suspension against only two of 18 players publicly linked to domestic violence allegations. In response to its inconsistent and flippant attitude toward stemming domestic violence, fans ( 24% of those surveyed) are abandoning the NFL.\n",
            "[Doc 1136]: Over the last decade, fantasy football is to thank for the soaring and sustained popularity of the NFL. Fantasy sports has become a massive $7 billion dollar industry ; the Fantasy Sports Trade Association estimates that of the 59 million people in the United States and Canada who play fantasy sports, 80% are playing fantasy football. People bet big money to be in fantasy football leagues and therefore have a lot riding on each NFL game. Therefore, they enthusiastically tune in to watch each of their players throughout the NFL season, even if their actual team is less than stellar. That fantasy football has become so mainstream and so intertwined with NFL football means that the latter will continue to remain as popular as ever.\n",
            "[Doc 2478]: Without the anxiety and fear of losing employment, teachers can focus their efforts on providing the best education for students.\n",
            "[Doc 1141]: An old cliché says that defense wins championships in footbal l, mostly because a first-class defense is almost impossible to beat during playoff s. If so, and if the strongest football team ever should be determined by the quality of defense, it has to be the 1985 Chicago Bears. The 1985 Chicago Bears were notorious for their impenetrable revolutionary defense, which played together from 1984 to 1986. They went 15-1 in the 1985 season, and won that year’s Super Bowl while setting an NFL record for 72 sacks, allowing only 10 points during the playoffs. The next year, they set a then-NFL record (for a 16-game season), allowing only 186 points and losing in the playoffs only to the upcoming champions, the Washington Redskins.\n",
            "[Doc 1828]: In direct election of the president, candidates might appeal to clusters of voters, whose votes could be aggregated across states and regions, perhaps representing only one strata of society.\n",
            "[Doc 1071]: Historic NFL teams with great defense, like the 1984 Chicago Bears or the 2015 Denver Broncos , are rare and therefore more memorable than teams with great offense. They demonstrate and validate the virtues of defense, which are often overlooked. This brings many sports figures (from players to commentators) to glorify defense and to believe that it wins NFL championships. While great defense has won championships for certain NFL teams, it doesn’t mean that defense always leads to championship victories. The main difference is that because the importance of offense in football is obvious, it isn’t as glorified as defense. But this doesn’t mean that offense doesn’t win championships or that defense more often wins championships.\n",
            "[Doc 543]: The 1991 Redskins finished their regular season in a fantastic 14-2 record. That record , together with their three wins in the NFL playoffs that year was made against the league’s toughest competition at that time. The Redskins’ opponents during the 1991 season had a collective record of .500 or better. There have been very few teams throughout NFL history that have played such a difficult schedule and played so remarkably despite of it. They won their first 11 games and lost only two games by a combined five points!\n",
            "[Doc 795]: The threat of jail time isn’t necessarily enough of a deterrent to those with a criminal streak, as evidenced by the number of repeat offenders who return to jail ( 44% before their first full year out of prison). By definition, jail is a loss of freedom, and this threat is enhanced when it includes the loss of democratic rights as well. While some may argue that many felons may be indifferent to losing the right to vote, the message is a societal one as much as a personal one: Criminal behavior is intolerable, and losing your most basic rights is fair game as a punishment.\n",
            "[Doc 1043]: The NFL is always evolving. During the past decade, there has been a shift in the league that favors the offense . Rules have changed that mostly favor offense . For example, with the Concussion Protocol, the ban on hitting a quarterback helmet-to-helmet, and on the “horse-collar tackle,” offense numbers are high. This trend is reflected in recent NFL seasons, which have been dominated by quarterbacks and passing offenses. The ball flies more , and apart from Super Bowl 50, recent seasons were dominated by offenses and specifically by Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes . Defense might have won football championships decades ago, but it doesn’t anymore.\n",
            "[Doc 2939]: Those who wish to seek the protection of the Geneva Conventions, the laws of war, have a duty to distinguish themselves from the civilian population (Detter, 2007). Terrorists who absolve themselves of this responsibility in the pursuit of wanton violence, who flagrantly ignore the laws of war, cannot thereafter appeal to its protection once captured. Such a norm is required in order to preserve the immunity of civilians and prevent the encouragement of using civilians as means to ends.\n",
            "[Doc 2159]: Part of the attraction of cannabis, especially among younger users is its appeal as a ‘forbidden fruit’. Removing that would mean that other, harder drugs would be sought out to fulfill the same need to rebel. A government sanction on a drug with a proven tendency to effect memory and other neurological functions would still hold open the door to other, more dangerous, drugs as a form of rebellion. In this regard the continued ban on cannabis – and the relative tolerance of the breach of that ban – sends out a clear message of ‘this far and no further’. Any signal that this narcotic is acceptable simply increases the stakes.\n",
            "[Doc 3017]: The film industry is losing a significant amount of money. For example, the most pirated film so far this year is Watchmen, with 16.9 million people watching it for free. The precipitous decline at box offices has been blamed on illegal file-sharing.\n",
            "[Doc 203]: The 1991 Redskins are the best team the game has ever seen mostly because they were one of the most balanced and varied Super Bowl winners . They were not about stars who shine and carry the team to glory; they were about hard-working, modest team players, who all played for one cause: winning. Together, they formed a whole that was bigger than the sum of its part . It is their team spirit that allowed them to dominate an NFL.\n",
            "[Doc 3211]: Taking a look at the legal profession we can see that the percentage of women in the highest powered jobs is minute. The position of Lord of Appeal in Ordinary holds only 8.33% of women, High Court judges is 10.09% and the position of Recorder is made up of 14% women. If we look at deputy judges the percentage takes a small leap to 27%. With figures like these it is hard to argue that the glass ceiling has disintegrated.\n",
            "[Doc 3654]: Any tax levied on purchases is inherently fairer. In the current system much of the burden falls on the poor, for the rich can afford accountants to help them find ways to avoid paying tax. A tax on sales can be adjusted so that goods which appeal to the poor are taxed less than goods bought by the rich: for example, Bentleys would be taxed greater than Beetles.\n",
            "[Doc 77]: One of the things that makes Formula 1 so special is the international locations and drivers that it features. Every race feels like a racing world cup, with dozens of countries featured. The very best race car drivers Holland has to offer and the top engineers from Germany join Formula 1.

The Church’s objectives are, instead, to either convert as many people as possible to its own religion, and to ‘save souls’ brining people into its own perceived afterlife. The current confusion of state and Church, therefore, is likely to cloud the state’s judgement and limit the state’s ability to provide the maximum possible prosperity and security for its people.\n",

            "[103/185] Summarizing: Messi or Ronaldo – who is truly the best?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 402]: Messi has an advantage over Ronaldo: Messi has won more titles mostly because he plays for a better team, not because he is a better player than Ronaldo. Throughout his entire career, Messi played for arguably the best side to ever play the game. Unlike Ronaldo’s team experiences, Messi’s Barcelona teammates know each other blindly, since most of them have played together since they were 10 years old, always the same style and formation. This is not to say that Ronaldo’s teammates on both teams were bad. They were great, but just not as great as Messi’s during the majority of his career. For example, Messi has played with Neymar Jr . (who is arguably the best player following Messi and Ronaldo) and Luis Suarez , two of the best forwards of the century, and with Xavi Hernandez and Andrés Iniesta, two of the most dominating center-midfielders of our era. While Messi has the added value of an unforgettable team, Ronaldo is the driving factor of his teams. Messi is like Tim Duncan of the Spurs, while Ronaldo is like LeBron James in Cleveland.\n",
            "[Doc 1052]: Both Ronaldo and Messi have impressive stats , but a closer look at them proves Messi makes better decisions and, more importantly, brings greater value to his team. Using a framework that was originally developed for baseball, The Economist once rated Messi’s and Ronaldo’s goals based on their context and importance. Over the years, Messi has continually managed to outscore Ronaldo in the last minutes of the game, otherwise known as injury-time goals . Moreover, Messi makes better decisions. Using a complex algorithm, a company called GoodCall values a player’s decision-making and Efficiency Per Match (EPM). This entails valuing each pass, shot, chance created or a dribble made by players, and then rating the player’s decision-making and efficiency. Messi’s EPM and decision-making rate have been higher than Ronaldo’s, over time.\n",
            "[Doc 233]: Ronaldo’s international career puts him on a higher level than Messi. In fact, before the 2022 World Cup , Messi never won an international trophy. He lost finals in both the Copa America (the South America championship) and the World Cup 2014. In addition, Ronaldo has better international goalscoring stats in competitive international games than Messi (102 goals compared to Messi’s 54), and even led his Portugal side to win the 2016 European Championship . And let’s not forget that Ronaldo is also the higher paid football player of the two, which proves his higher worth.\n",
            "[Doc 751]: Messi and Ronaldo differ mostly in their style. Ronaldo is a machine. He is an explosive player, with abnormal physical abilities and a huge amount of talent. Tall and strong and certainly one of the greatest players, Ronaldo doesn’t possess Messi’s magic. The Argentine is a greater natural talent. He is a virtuoso, a magician. His dribbling is considered to be the best the game has ever seen, and he passes and shoots the ball with the precision of a brain surgeon. He makes eye-popping moves that leave people speechless and overwhelmed. Seeing him weave his way through a team’s defense and then put the ball past the keeper is just something special.\n",
            "[Doc 732]: Nowadays, soccer is more dynamic and athletic than ever. The game has become faster, stronger and more demanding in most aspects of physicality. While Messi might have more talent, Ronaldo’s combination of physical and technical abilities just makes him better. He is 6’’1 of pure Portuguese muscle . This means he’s very hard to push off the ball. Ronaldo’s combination of dizzying pace, great dribbling and powerful shooting with either foot terrorizes defenses. He is simply a better fit for today’s game. His athleticism is second to none; he combines dizzying pace with powerful shooting and jumping ability of an NBA star, which makes his headers a serious threat to the opposition. And he’s doing it at the same level even in his late-30s. Ronaldo, more than Messi, is the ideal model for the next generation of players.\n",
            "[Doc 669]: Messi is not only an incredible scorer and gifted playmaker, he also makes everyone around him a better player. A true leader, he brings his team together. Not only does he have more assists and key passes than Ronaldo, he is always using his phenomenal vision to keep his teammates involved. He has great tactical intelligence, finding free spaces to move into, receiving the ball and then laying it off to a team-mate, to build attacks. While Ronaldo is more of an executor, who plays high up the pitch and scores great goals when given the chance, Messi, who can do that just as well, is also comfortable dropping deep and keeping possession of the ball with his team. From these positions, he can send his colleagues on dangerous runs with pin-point passes, like he did in the 2022 World Cup game against Croatia . This versatility makes him that much better than Ronaldo.\n",
            "[Doc 1553]: People are only truly free to say what they wish when they do not have to worry about being personally persecuted, either by peers, strangers, or their government, for what they are saying.\n",
            "[Doc 2280]: Even if a voucher scheme is used, parents still need to have considerable input in order that their children are able to access the best educational opportunities. Thus, those children who are most vulnerable, i.e. those with inadequate home support structures, will find that they are unable to access the best schools as their parents may lack the desire or knowledge to find out which schools are the best in their area. Further, this problem will be exacerbated by the subsequent dearth of funding at the worst schools.\n",
            "[Doc 3344]: There is no proof that those who are lying on the streets are actually homeless. They could go home, into the warmth, with their loving family. By giving these people money without any proof, you are stopping the people who really need the money from receiving it. Instead the money should go to a large charity whereby they help the people who truly need it by providing clean housing and food; the essentials.\n",
            "[Doc 1776]: When the government allows religion to act on its behalf, it confuses the role of the state and the role of religious groups. As it stands, religious groups do not appear to be truly answerable to the state and, therefore, it is unclear whether they or the government are the higher authority.\n",
            "[Doc 3774]: It is impossible for everyone to start on a ‘equal footing’. Society can never be truly meritocratic, and to prevent someone from starting off in a financially secure position in life simply because there are others who can’t is callous and unjust. What people choose to do with the money they have earned is their right, and should be respected if they wish to pass this on.\n",
            "[Doc 2296]: Parents are the ones who are responsible for their children and they know what is best for their own. Parents are the people who best know their children; they live with them, feed them, understand them, and know how and when is best to broach the topic of sex with their children. Parents are in a very real way the shapers of children’s psyche and development, so their input on a central moral and physical issue such as this must be respected. It is a myth that somehow parents lacks the capacity to deal with an issue like sex. Rather, they are the best suited to it. The fact is that children generally listen to their parents, or at least consider seriously what they are told by them. Furthermore, parents are more capable than teachers, in light of their intimate relationship with their children, to discuss the emotional aspects of sex and relationships, topics that would become jokes in the classroom and the subject of ribald humour.

            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 1959]: If the country is in trouble is the army the best placed to take over and manage the country better than it has been in the past? This may plausibly be true if the reason democracy is failing is a large scale insurgency or near civil war but in almost every other case it is not the best institution. The army is trained to fight not to govern. The generals who take over top positions are used to running a bureaucracy that has to respond to politicians, not one that has to respond to the people. Politicians may be corrupt, venal, or unpopular but at the least they are open about what they stand for. They have a manifesto and a clear ideology which if the people don't agree with they wont be voted for. This is not the case with generals; the chances are they have a bureaucratic desire to maintain the power and funding for the military but otherwise there is likely to be little known about their politics. Finally for those who are being overthrown the electorate has had a chance to investigate their policies, their past, to question their views and catch the candidate out when they are not consistent. The candidate came through an electoral test and media grilling. When there is a coup there is no such chance to determine if the coup leader is the right man for the job.\n",
            "[Doc 1517]: Numerous studies have shown that children do best when they are raised by two married, biological parents1. In the case of adopted children that is impossible, but a man and a woman is the best approximation of that family. Since that is the best environment to raise children, the government has to encourage and promote these traditional unions, not undermine them. Allowing gay couples to legally become parents, would legally and socially redefine what a family is and society as a whole may suffer. Children who are adopted already face bullying and exclusion in school because of their difference, placing them in same-sex households will double their exclusion and make their lives much harder than if placed in an opposite-sex household.\n",
            "[Doc 1518]: The focus of this debate should not be on gay rights, but on what is in the best interest of the adopted child. The adoption process' goal is to find the most suitable parents for that child, not to resolve other social inequalities and injustices. Being raised in a traditional family, by a mother and father, is the best environment for a child. Studies have shown that children who are raised by homosexual couples can have problems with substance abuse, violence and 'at risk' behaviour. Therefore the state has the obligation to try to provide the child with that environment.\n",
            "[Doc 3393]: The internet and traditional mass media are the most effective ways to spread information on the world rigth now. Its creation changed forever our access to information and has become an indispensable part of daily life in the modern world. But we have to remember that less than 30% of our global population has access to the internet , therefore, media 24hour intense broadcasting of illness prevention or possible spread, terrorist menaces and murder cases become, on most cases, vital for people's security. No matter the opinions on these matters, they always promote prevention, maybe it can seem obsesive and repetitive... but what if you only have access to traditional media on a determined hour of a day? can the governments truly take on the task of informing all of its population of such things? can they have similar reach? The spread of a certain illness, murders and terrorist threats ARE A PROBLEM, its coverage, helps PREVENT THEM. The value of prevention can only be truly understood by those who underestimated it when they most needed it.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 2200]: Although it might be very tempting for the government to try and attack the problem of childhood obesity by attempting to change, in essence, the very choices our kids can make, this is the wrong way of going about doing it. The purpose of schools is education – the genesis of active and useful members of society. A large extent of what schools do is imprinting the ideas the society values. In most western countries those would be the ideas of fairness, democracy, freedom of expression, etc. The other side of the coin is the transference of knowledge, knowledge of mathematics, history, but also of biology, health and nutrition. We see thus that the proposed ban on specific choices one makes in school, whether be it choices regarding food or choices regarding the clothes one wears, the ideas one expresses, and so on, is truly meaningless in the existing concept of education. What the schools should be doing is putting more emphasis on getting the message of the importance of a healthy lifestyle across. Our kids should be taught that this lifestyle consists of more than just whether or not we chose to eat a hamburger and fries for lunch. In short, this ban falls short of truly educating the children about how important physical activity, balanced meals and indulging in moderation are. They should also focus on the importance of choice, since in the case of childhood obesity, making the right nutritional and lifestyle choices is of paramount importance. But they should also focus on the importance of choice for a society and how all should take responsibility for their choices in such a society.\n",
            "[Doc 4063]: When answering the question of whether or not something should be banned, we must look at the what is being lost in the world of the stakeholders while that action or thing is still being permitted. In the context of this debate, we believe that there are unique benefits to receiving an education outside of the home that are so conclusive and so vital that they make school an absolute necessity that every child should partake in. A crucial part of an education outside of the home is the interaction amongst the students that is used to prepare them to have constructive engagements with fellow citizens when their schooling is over. Interacting with other children who may be taught different belief systems and come from different social-economic statuses and religious or ethnic backgrounds prepare students for their future, where the potential of having to deal with someone who is different is almost inevitable. While there may be attempts by parents to socialize their children through other means (such as joining sports teams or youth clubs), these organizations are centered around similarity - all the kids that enjoy the same thing or believe in the same values congregate. School is a mixture that does not filter out students, and there is an inherent social value to such a mix. We believe that governments have a duty to ensure, or at the very at least, provide children the potential to interact with other children of different backgrounds at such a crucial time of their development as active and productive citizens. The only way to do this is to eliminate systems such as homeschooling that promote exclusivity under the guise of protection. The only way to truly hold the child's interests as a priority is to to prepare them for the society that they will soon inherit; homeschooling attempts to construct a world for the child that often does not match reality.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 1225]: The 1984 draft included Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton. Hakeem won two championships, was twice named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, and once the finals MVP. Barkley and Stockton won the Western Conference and made it to the finals three times (combined), only to lose to Michael Jordan. The 1984 draft players reached the NBA finals five times in the 90`s, which is considered as the league`s golden era. This era was dominated by Jordan , but if it wasn’t for him, it is fair to say that his 1984-draft buddies would have dominated and would have won more championship rings. Take out Jordan, and the 1984 draft is still the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 742]: The NFL draft is about making choices, which is always a question of alternatives. When picking Russell, the Raiders could have chosen Calvin Johnson, who was a great option and was considered as one of the most dynamic receivers in the league for a decade. Potential future Hall of Famers Joe Thomas (who is in the College Football Hall of Fame ), Adrian Peterson and Patrick Willis were alternative choices for Russell. The Chargers’ choice of Leaf is more understandable. During the 1998 draft, the Chargers needed a QB. They preferred Peyton Manning (who is considered one of the best QB of all times), but he was chosen first by the Colts. The Chargers were left with Leaf, who was then considered around the same level as Manning . So, the Raiders had better options and yet made the worst choice, which makes Russell a bigger bust.\n",
            "[Doc 603]: Though overshadowed by widespread negative coverage, the NFL’s national anthem protests have led to positive developments. At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice.\n",
            "[Doc 344]: The NBA draft is about predicting each player’s ability. Teams make selections according to a player`s potential and talent. The best draft should be the one with the most talented – not the most successful – players. The 1996 draft had the most talented players, including Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant , two of the most talented NBA players ever, and other huge talents like Steve Nash and Stephon Marbury. The 1984 draft didn’t have the most talented players. Hakeem, Barkley and John Stockton were superstars with huge careers, but mostly due to their characters and determination, not necessarily due to their talent. If you look at drafts by the amount of talent, it`s the 1996 that claims the top spot.\n",
            "[Doc 625]: Draft busts aren’t set solely by players’ failures to meet expectations but also by their field performance. The intensity of a player’s failure on the field is a decisive factor when evaluating bust levels. A look at the stats of Leaf and Russell proves that Leaf was a bigger failure on the field.\n",
            "[Doc 209]: Like it or not, NBA basketball is a game of super stars. Players have a substantial impact on the game, their team, and even on their team`s squads and managerial decisions. Their egos are huge, and rightfully so, because during the money time, it`s them out there; they take the shots, and they take the blame for missed shots. Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever. Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton are Hall of Famers who were THE superstars of the golden era. Until today, they are considered as one of the best in their positions. The 1984 draft had the biggest star quality ever and should be considered the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 778]: Once considered a great unifier of American society, NFL football suddenly became a political and social divider in the summer of 2016. That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest. For many , NFL games – and post-game analyses – no longer provide an escape from draining politics but have turned into an unwelcome extension of it.\n",
            "[Doc 443]: Russell`s work ethic and weight were the main reasons for his failure during his NFL years. These problems were known prior to his selection in the 2007 draft. Scout reports indicated a potential weight problem that could affect his quickness and agility, as well as his supposed poor work ethic . On the other hand, Leaf was supposed to be the next-big-thing in the NFL , and was one of the most coveted players in the1998 draft. Most scouts identified a vast amount of talent in him , and he was considered as being at the same level as Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. Eventually, it was a combination of injuries, immaturity , and lack of passion that paved Leaf’s way out of the league. Leaf was a typical example of a quarterback who had everything a coach would want in a quarterback . So, in comparison to Russell, whose problems were well known, Leaf`s failure was more surprising and disappointing.\n",
            "[Doc 1136]: Over the last decade, fantasy football is to thank for the soaring and sustained popularity of the NFL. Fantasy sports has become a massive $7 billion dollar industry ; the Fantasy Sports Trade Association estimates that of the 59 million people in the United States and Canada who play fantasy sports, 80% are playing fantasy football. People bet big money to be in fantasy football leagues and therefore have a lot riding on each NFL game. Therefore, they enthusiastically tune in to watch each of their players throughout the NFL season, even if their actual team is less than stellar. That fantasy football has become so mainstream and so intertwined with NFL football means that the latter will continue to remain as popular as ever.\n",
            "[Doc 2094]: Western countries are the biggest contributors to the IMF. They bring in the most money and, until recently, have rarely required loans from the institution themselves. In any business, the biggest shareholders get to have the most say in the decision-making process. The IMF should not be different.\n",
            "[Doc 303]: They say you`re as good as your weakest link. The 1984 draft had no weak links. Who could be considered the weakest link there exactly? John Stockton , the league leader in assists and steals to this day? Or Sir Charles (Barkley ), who was one of the greatest rebounders of his time? The 1996 draft had far more weaker links, especially compared to Barkley or Stockton. Steve Nash was considered as a lesser version of Stockton, and a far worse defensive player. Allen Iverson is considered one of the most talented players ever, but he never fulfilled his potential. Kobe Bryant was a phenomenon, but if you consider players like Markus Camby, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, or Stephon Marbury of the 1996 draft, this one had weaker links.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 323]: Long before Colin Kaepernick took a knee, the NFL was dealing with another scandal involving a number of its players perpetrating domestic abuse . The latest headlines show the Patriots’ receiver, Antonio Brown being accused of multiple incidents of alleged sexual assault. He is by no means the only one . In the summer of 2014, after being accused of mishandling the infamous Ray Rice incident, in which the Baltimore Ravens player was caught on video beating his then-fiancé, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new league policy to punish any player involved in domestic violence or sexual assault with a six-game suspension without pay. However, it was inconsistently reinforced, and even updated in 2016 with more loopholes. Since then, the NFL appears to have softened its stance, enforcing the six-game suspension against only two of 18 players publicly linked to domestic violence allegations. In response to its inconsistent and flippant attitude toward stemming domestic violence, fans ( 24% of those surveyed) are abandoning the NFL.\n",
            "[Doc 1443]: Signatories of The 1951 Convention on Refugees have a legal responsibility to offer asylum to any foreign national who has a well-founded fear of persecution, for political, religious, ethnic or social reasons, and who is unwilling to return home. Moreover the refugee is protected against forcible return when his life may be threatened, something which is an obligation even for countries which are not parties to the convention bust respect as it is part of international customary law.\n",
            "[Doc 1143]: In 2017, neuropathologist Dr. Ann McKee published a study examining 111 brains of former NFL football players, of which 110 were found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ). This degenerative brain disease is associated with repeated blows to the head. It causes brain injury, memory loss, depression, dementia, liver disorder, addiction to painkillers and even suicide, all long after the blows have stopped. Showing the direct relation between these dire health consequences and playing football has changed the way lifelong fans now view NFL games. Many say it is now too difficult to watch the violence on the field without thinking about the human damage their favorite players may suffer as a direct consequence. Players themselves, even first-draft ones like Andrew Luck , are also saying “no more” to the physical pain from football-related injuries and retiring early. Fears of brain and other injuries and long-term damage, especially resulting from on-field concussions, have also affected younger players. Compared to 2008, when participation in high-school football peaked at 1.11 million student athletes, 2017 showed a 5% decline to just 1.06 million players\n",
            "[Doc 1071]: Historic NFL teams with great defense, like the 1984 Chicago Bears or the 2015 Denver Broncos , are rare and therefore more memorable than teams with great offense. They demonstrate and validate the virtues of defense, which are often overlooked. This brings many sports figures (from players to commentators) to glorify defense and to believe that it wins NFL championships. While great defense has won championships for certain NFL teams, it doesn’t mean that defense always leads to championship victories. The main difference is that because the importance of offense in football is obvious, it isn’t as glorified as defense. But this doesn’t mean that offense doesn’t win championships or that defense more often wins championships.\n",
            "[Doc 543]: The 1991 Redskins finished their regular season in a fantastic 14-2 record. That record , together with their three wins in the NFL playoffs that year was made against the league’s toughest competition at that time. The Redskins’ opponents during the 1991 season had a collective record of .500 or better. There have been very few teams throughout NFL history that have played such a difficult schedule and played so remarkably despite of it. They won their first 11 games and lost only two games by a combined five points!\n",
            "[Doc 11]: Auerbach had a special eye for discovering rising stars and building a winning team out of them. He pushed hard for Bill Russell in the 1956 NBA draft, seeing huge potential in his defensive qualities. Russell became a key part in the team’s ability to stop opposition advances and then start their own counterattacks. Molding young players in the ways he saw fit, Auerbach offered a springboard to players like John Havlicek, who then became the engine behind many of the championships they won together. In 1978, it was Auerbach’s vision that drove the Celtics to draft Larry Bird, who was still relatively unknown. He turned out to be one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen. Auerbach’s negotiation skills were key here as they gave him an edge in getting the players he wanted.\n",
            "[Doc 3879]: The biggest collection of specialist scientists in the world say that the worlds climate is changing as a result of human activity. The scientific community almost unanimously agrees that man-caused global warming is a severe threat, and the evidence is stacking.\n",

            "[105/185] Summarizing: Are Basketball Players the Best Athletes?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 585]: Basketball players combine a wide range of athletic abilities. While hockey and soccer players might be faster, and NFL football players might be stronger, it can be argued that basketball players are better all-around athletes. After all, they demonstrate great endurance as they run up and down the court, playing both offense and aggressive defense. They’re strong and possess an impressive amount of speed and agility . And, of course, they possess amazing jumping ability. The wide range of their athletic abilities makes them the most versatile athletes in sports, thus the best athletes.\n",
            "[Doc 1148]: Much like in basketball, playing professional NFL football requires a combination of strength, agility, speed and concentration. However, the level of strength needed to play football is the most important, and certainly greater than any other athletic ability needed to play basketball. Football players present an unprecedented power, strength and explosiveness. They deal with 250-300-pound titans ( most of whom can bench press over 500 lbs .) in an aggressive game that involves much more physical contact and collisions than basketball. While football players are not as quick as basketball players, they`re much stronger , which puts them on another level of athleticism.\n",
            "[Doc 275]: An important argument coming from those who oppose paying college athletes is the expected difficulty involved with implementing such a move. The following are just some of the questions that pinpoint the complexities: Who will pay the college athletes? How often will they receive pay? Will there be a salary cap? Who gets paid and how much? Will female college athletes benefit as much as their male counterparts? Theoretically, the athletes to get paid the most should be the ones playing the sports that bring in the big money, namely, men’s college basketball and football players. This is capitalism, and this is how it works in America. Time will tell who ultimately benefits the most from this decision.\n",
            "[Doc 300]: The one thing that makes tennis players greater athletes than basketball players is that it’s each player for himself or herself on the court. Every sport requires a level of athleticism, but tennis players have to execute their athletic abilities in every single moment of the game, while remaining at the highest level of focus. There are no substitutions, no “weak” moments when the game is played elsewhere or when a teammate takes over control of the game. The combination of the athletic features together with the intensity and mental abilities required to play it alone makes tennis players the best athletes in sports. Just take a look at Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal’s athletic abilities:\n",
            "[Doc 1140]: The NBA has changed in recent years. Today, the game favors speed and shooting. This change didn’t occur out of nowhere – it happened after a new era of players with greater physical and athletic abilities arrived in the league. NBA players now combine height together with shooting abilities and speed (which was considered rare only 15 years ago). Also, as basketball became faster, players needed to develop more endurance. Given that some players shoot from such a large distance away from the basket (like the late Kobe Bryant did, and today’s Stephen Curry still does) that some suggest moving the 3-point line back or even applying a 4-point line . This is an example of how basketball players’ athletic abilities have gotten significantly better, which can’t be said for athletes in any other sport.\n",
            "[Doc 802]: Basketball players demonstrate most of their athletic abilities while in the air. This might be stating the obvious since its basketball we`re talking about, but the more you think about it, the more you understand how being airborne makes everything harder. It’s not just their jumping ability; basketball players also need to be agile, creative and demonstrate flexibility while in mid-air , especially since, most of the time, there’s a ginormous center jumping between them and the basket. They also need to aim and score, block shots and make physical contact, all within seconds while off the ground, when they’re most vulnerable.\n",
            "[Doc 1154]: Professional athletes sacrifice important aspects of their lives, especially their health and family. For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families. More significant, though, is that players put their bodies in danger daily. Physical injury can leave professional athletes handicapped or disabled for the rest of their lives; NFL players who experience multiple concussions can suffer from progressive degenerative disease that causes dementia and depression. Additionally, while most teenagers or college-age students spend their free time studying, working or hanging out, student athletes aiming to qualify for the pros spend all of their free time training. Thus, professional athletes’ salaries are a fair compensation for the countless time and energy they put into training and the huge health risks they take, especially considering that their careers typically end around the age of 35.\n",
            "[Doc 653]: The mythical status of all professional athletes is long gone. Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods are just a couple examples of professional athletes who are no longer seen as being role models for youngsters. Today, we know much more about our sports heroes’ lives, for better and for worse. This insight has contributed to the erosion of their status as heroes. As athletes’ statuses change, our attitudes toward them do as well. This has led to a growing public understanding and acceptance of athletes who use PEDs. Thus, our criteria for including baseball players in the National Baseball Hall of Fame has softened over the years , allowing for the inclusion of PED users. In fact, some voters don’t feel that they should be passing judgement on players who used PEDs when there are reportedly racists, gamblers and wife beaters in the Hall of Fame.\n",
            "[Doc 471]: The large amounts of money invested in professional sports in recent years has the potential to drain the true meaning from sports. Given athletes’ large salaries, more youngsters want to become professional athletes – but for the big money, not for the love of the game. This change in purpose has a negative impact on athletes’ ambition to play. Take Albert Haynesworth of the Washington Redskins. Once he signed a $100 million contract with a $44 million guarantee, he had what some consider to be his worst season ever; it seemed like he simply lost interest in the game. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans.\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 502]: One of the best aspects of college sports is the players’ enthusiasm. Their love and passion for their respective game is admirable and infectious. But, there is a downside to it; in their fervor to play their best, many college athletes suffer serious injuries that sometimes prematurely end their career. Setting aside the disturbing fact that a career-ending injury will stop their scholarship, those college athletes put their bodies at risk of permanent damage, without being paid. Hurting your knee might leave you limping for the rest of your life. Suffering concussions can cause dementia and depression, not to mention CTE . Those college athletes who put their bodies on the line for each training session and game they play deserve to be paid for the health risks they are taking.\n",
            "[Doc 1045]: While the highest paid athletes draw more attention, the truth is that most athletes are fairly paid . Plus, we tend to forget that published professional athletes’ salaries are gross salaries. While these may seem huge, so are the deductions from them. Aside from federal, state and city taxes and pension, which everyone pays, players also need to pay agent fees, a $10,000 union due, and a Jock Tax for each of their away games, among others. Sure, their net salaries may be higher than ours, but they are still lower than we tend to think and much lower than what is published.\n",
            "[Doc 564]: Boxing is the most athletic sport around. In fact, boxing is used in training for NFL players to enhance their hand-eye coordination and agility. A few years ago, a wide panel of sports experts, including sports scientists, researchers, athletes and journalists, objectively ranked the level of athleticism needed to compete in 60 sports. To determine the level of athleticism needed, each sport was broken down into 10 categories: endurance, strength, power, speed, agility, flexibility, nerve, durability, hand-eye coordination and analytic aptitude. Then, the experts ranked each category for each sport. The average represents the difficulty level of each sport. According to the most scientific comparative research made in that subject, boxers are the best athletes, not basketball players.\n",
            "[Doc 830]: There are so many clean professional baseball players who have never used PEDs. These clean players were forced to compete against players who had an illegal advantage over them, and they consequently may have lost opportunities to earn more money and advance in their career and status. The least we can do is reward these clean players by not admitting the PED users into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Doing so is like spitting in the faces of the upstanding players.\n",
            "[Doc 4011]: Historically, some athletes have decided to get an edge against their competition by utilizing illegal substances or have been negatively influences to do so by their social network, trainers, teammates or peer pressure. This goes against the maxim of what healthy competition represents. Council of Europe in the Code of Sports Ethics The potential benefits to society and to the individual from sport will only be maximised where fair play is centre stage. The truth is that whenever doping is discussed the debate is centered around why do athletes fall into the temptation that banned substances represent, but the main reasons why athletes do not cheat are rarely mentioned. Fact is that the main reason athletes choose not to cheat is the risk of being caught, so this leads to the argument that the risk of cheating has to be so big and the consequences so harsh that more athletes will choose to remain clean. Sociologist Howard S.Becker published a classic work in 1963 called Outsiders which illustrates that athletes' main reasons to avoid taking illegal substances hardly ever relate to moral standards or health issues, though they may factor in the decision. The reason for not doping back when the study was made that was given repeatedly was the fear that it would be socially excluding; that it would ruin the athlete's reputation if he or she were caught. The best way to illustrate how the larger risk represented through the removal of all medals to an Olympic Team will further deter the use of banned substances will be to analyze the situation from a trainer's point of view. In most cases, athletes are either recommended to use the substances by their trainers or at least the trainer is aware of the use of said substances. So, if a trainer knows than one of his athlete's does not stand a chance to win, he may support the use of banned substances. However, if that athlete's decision could hurt the entire team, he would prevent it from happening.\n",
            "[Doc 1284]: Once some people choose to use drugs to enhance their performance, other athletes have their freedom of choice infringed upon: if they want to succeed they have to take drugs too. Athletes are very driven individuals, who would go to great lengths to achieve their goals. The chance of a gold medal in two years’ time may out-weigh the risks of serious health problems for the rest of their life. We should protect athletes from themselves and not allow anyone to take performance-enhancing drugs. An example of the pressure is cycling.\n",
            "[Doc 1534]: Assuming we would have two equally muscular and equally fast male and female athletes, the current system clearly discriminates the female athlete by not allowing her to compete in the male league. It is against the very nature of sports to treat differently two athletes who have the same strength, speed, agility, dexterity, mental focus, determination, ambition based purely on their type of chromosomes. This is extremely important as most of the time the women’s competition gets less attention from the public and sponsors, as seen in the cases of Women’s National Basketball Association and National Women’s Football Association. So, by forcing them to stay in those leagues, you are denying potentially successful athletes fame, pride and money. The Giro Rosa, one of the biggest women cycling competition, offers a prize money of 460 Euros, which is a mere thousandth of the Tour de France's 450,000 Euro top prize.\n",
            "[Doc 718]: Sports like basketball and football are deeply intertwined with American culture. It has become a family ritual to watch the baseball World Series in the fall and football on Thanksgiving. The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting and arguably cultural event in the country. Playing fantasy football and following college basketball March Madness unites college fans, families and colleagues all over the country. To many, basketball is a great unifier: it’s seen as an integral part of inner-city culture just as much as it is of suburban America. Through their presence in US history, these sports have become synonymous with being American. Soccer may never evoke such feelings of history, identity and pride.\n",
            "[Doc 159]: People argue that paying collage athletes will help create a sense of financial awareness for them. However, in reality, poor investments, trusting unethical financial advisors and lavish spending habits are some of the main reasons professional athletes find themselves broke after they retire, according to ESPN documentary, “Broke.” Without sound financial education, young college athletes may not be equipped to handle so much money .\n",
            "[Doc 1526]: Limiting the number of overseas players will be good for home-grown sportsmen. At present only a tiny handful of the best native players will get a chance to play for top clubs due to their profit and success motives. This means that talented young players see no reason to work hard and develop their game, because it is so unlikely they will get a chance to play at the top level. And clubs don’t have a reason to seek out local youngsters and train them, as it is easier to buy a fully trained player from abroad. Limiting the number of foreign players would create incentives for both players and clubs to make the most of their talents. As a result, domestic crowds would rise as quality would improve proportionally with the development of local talent.\n",

            "[106/185] Summarizing: LeBron James Vs. Michael Jordan: Who’s the greatest of all time?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 177]: While Kobe fans argue that he was a better clutch player (the one who makes the most important shots, especially in the game’s last minutes) than LeBron, this claim is far from reality. LeBron, who does not choke, is a better clutch player , and this argument is backed by stats . A look into Kobe vs. LeBron regarding clutch-time stats proves LeBron is better than Kobe was in the most important time of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 100]: Both James and Jordan are amazing offensive players that can dominate games like few others. But James also has the edge over Jordan in terms of defense. Around 25-30 pounds heavier, two inches taller and with a significantly longer wingspan, James is much more of physical presence on the court. This makes him able to defend all five positions on the floor, from point guards to power forwards. James also leads his team to defend as a unit, making it that much more effective. If they had ever played each other, James could have likely come out on top in terms of defense.\n",
            "[Doc 512]: James is also a better passer than Jordan ever was. He averages 7.9 assists per game , while the Bulls and Wizards star had only 5.3 assists in an average game. Unlike Jordan, James has no problem letting go of the ball and passing it to a teammate. His ability to read the game and other players and involve his team when needed makes him that much harder to play against (maybe even “unguardable”), rather than an individual who keeps the ball all the time. Providing teammates with key assists are a big part of James’s game, whereas Jordan was always seen as more of a selfish player.\n",
            "[Doc 686]: Jordan is very likely to have been the most clutch player that has ever played the game. This means that he was able to raise his game when the pressure was the highest. His game winner , during his last Chicago Bulls game to secure the championship and his second three-peat with the team, stands out. Jordan won the NBA finals MVP award six times , compared to James’s four times. Sure James is now the NBA top scorer of all time, but Jordan was known as a king at scoring the game-winning shot in the final seconds of play. On the other hand, James still struggles to shed his reputation as a “ choker ,” for having fallen direly short in big moments. Jordan is better because he always delivered the good when it really mattered.\n",
            "[Doc 1004]: No one could split a defense to score the game-winning shot like Jordan could. His dribbling, jumping, footwork and lethal scoring ability made him a nightmare to defend against. His lightning-fast first step often left opponents in the dust while he created space to score. It took until 2019 for someone ( James ) to pass Jordan on the NBA’s all-time scoring records for most points scored on average during a season. Offensively, Jordan was just unstoppable .\n",
            "[Doc 687]: LeBron might be more dominant player, but Kobe was a more versatile and well-rounded player, which gives him the edge in this debate. While LeBron is an all-around player, with explosive power that makes him almost impossible to guard, he lacks instinct and on-court elegance and style. In comparison, Kobe was a virtuoso on offense, a better finisher and a better defender. He also had amazing anticipation and instincts that were perfected with Phil Jackson’s triangle offense. The Phoenix Suns’ forward, Grant Hill, who guarded both players, told Sports Illustrated : “He [LeBron] has the two pitches… both of them are great. But Kobe is like the guy with all the pitches. He brings his fastball, his change, gives you something on the corner… With Kobe, you’re never comfortable.” When it comes to Kobe vs. LeBron, the latter is great but the former was something truly special.\n",
            "[Doc 460]: In basketball, many great players succeeded as parts of great teams. However, unlike Jordan, James led an arguably average Cleveland Cavaliers to win the NBA championship in 2016. In each subsequent season with them until he left to join the LA Lakers in 2018, James’ leadership in getting the Cavs to the finals was also a truly special achievement . While the Cavs ended up losing those subsequent finals, it was only because James faced a stacked Golden State Warriors team with far more individual quality than the Cavs. In both Cleveland and LA, James has proven that he can be a true leader , making everyone else around him bring their A-game.\n",
            "[Doc 2]: A huge part of Michael Jordan`s legacy was earned on the day he won game five of the 1997 finals in Utah , when he dropped 38 points (including a clutch 3-pointer) with flu-like symptoms, including an extremely high fever. This is what makes a legend. Similarly, Kobe took over game four in the 2000 finals with an injured ankle. He also won finals with a damaged index finger. His work ethic and ambition were inspiring. He was a rip-your-heart-out-and-watch-it-beat-in-his-hands kind of player, regardless of his physical condition. While LeBron can demolish every opponent, many argue that his spirit is different than Kobe’s. It is thought that LeBron lacks the magic touch that Kobe possessed, which sets a player apart from the rest. The ability to perform when it matters most, against all odds, which Kobe did repeatedly, defines real legends.\n",
            "[Doc 209]: Like it or not, NBA basketball is a game of super stars. Players have a substantial impact on the game, their team, and even on their team`s squads and managerial decisions. Their egos are huge, and rightfully so, because during the money time, it`s them out there; they take the shots, and they take the blame for missed shots. Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever. Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton are Hall of Famers who were THE superstars of the golden era. Until today, they are considered as one of the best in their positions. The 1984 draft had the biggest star quality ever and should be considered the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 963]: Defense wins titles. Sure, you have to be a good offensive team, obviously, but in the nerve-racking finals , having a better defensive team has, historically, made winning the title more likely. In the Kobe vs. LeBron debate, both players were/are huge talents with enormous offensive abilities. While LeBron was named six times in the NBA All-Defensive team , Kobe was named 12 times in the NBA All-Defensive team. The latter’s defensive contribution was key in breaking up opponents’ movements and starting counterattacks. This diverse skill set gave him more of an ability to lift up his team in any stage of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 899]: Professional sports is a money-earning business. Sports teams know that to stay profitable they need to win, which is why they sign the best players available. Quality superstars, or “franchise players ,” are the face of the team. They make their teammates better, thereby improving the whole team (think Tom Brady Kevin Durant , and, of course, Michael Jordan , etc.). This leads to more wins and, in turn, more viewers, more merchandise sold and increased brand worth. Usually, a team has one franchise player, who makes a huge salary, arguably more than his projected value, since he drives the team’s business profitability forward. The amount of money that team owners are willing to pay franchise players often comes at the expense of the other players. However, with fans willing to pay more than 100% premiums on tickets to see individual players, like LeBron James, franchise players have extra responsibility to live up to their star power. They also have the celebrity effect, which draws more paying fans in. Therefore, they deserve to earn more.\n",
            "[Doc 1225]: The 1984 draft included Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton. Hakeem won two championships, was twice named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, and once the finals MVP. Barkley and Stockton won the Western Conference and made it to the finals three times (combined), only to lose to Michael Jordan. The 1984 draft players reached the NBA finals five times in the 90`s, which is considered as the league`s golden era. This era was dominated by Jordan , but if it wasn’t for him, it is fair to say that his 1984-draft buddies would have dominated and would have won more championship rings. Take out Jordan, and the 1984 draft is still the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 927]: When Kobe played, he had a better supportive team around him, both on the court and in the coach position. Three out of Kobe`s five rings were won together with Shaquille O’Neil , possibly the best center to ever play the game. Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, although none of them is a hall-of-famer, make a fantastic supportive team. Moreover, Kobe won his five rings with former coach Phil Jackson , who many argue is probably the sharpest basketball mind to ever exist. Meanwhile, LeBron won his first two rings as part of the Miami Heat`s trio. Aside from Dwayne Wade, LeBron’s supportive team lacked the quality that Kobe`s support had. LeBron won his championship third ring against a team that scored the best regular season record ever. LeBron won the finals’ MVP award and was the most dominant player in every championship he won. He might have fewer championship rings than Kobe had, but he played a bigger part in achieving them.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 362]: Jackson won so much because he had the ability to help his players grow in ways that others couldn’t. A big part of this was mentality; he taught big egos, like Michael Jordan , to be more team-oriented. He also managed to convince great talents, like Scottie Pippen, to play second-fiddle to greater ones, like Jordan. Similarly, it was a huge achievement of his to get Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal to form such a deadly on-field partnership, given their many disagreements, which have their own wikipedia page . Jackson had a unique style of coaching, inspired by Zen Buddhism and earning him the nickname “the Zen Master.” Perhaps it was this mindfulness that allowed him to calm and manage hot tempers. Some of these men were molded by Jackson into the winners we know them as.\n",
            "[Doc 3097]: It is a mish-mash of cobbled together rules from different languages with as many exceptions as there are words that obey the rules. People argue over the rules constantly and very few people know them or use them correctly. In many cases, such as inflammable vs. flammable, disorient vs. disorientate, the correct version sounds more awkward than the incorrect version.

            "[Doc 44]: For all the talk of today’s cinematic spies with a conscience and Daniel Craig’s success in humanizing James Bond, it’s important to remember that 007 is not meant to be a real person but the ultimate alpha male fantasy. In his books (at least until his 12th book), author and creator Ian Fleming never gave James Bond a backstory; he eats in restaurants, lives in hotels, sleeps with whatever woman he wants, and kills people. Connery masterfully embodied this fantasy figure with his suave, aloof and untroubled portrayal of James Bond. Connery brought unflappable calm to the role, whether he was killing bad people are charming women. In so doing, he perfectly embodied the fantasy and escapism that is James Bond.\n",
            "[Doc 82]: Jordan is probably the biggest brand ambassador that basketball and the NBA have ever had. He was a mythical player, who moved and scored in ways that set him apart from everyone else. His fadeaway jump shot. His up-and-under finish. His ability to make it look easy to slip by the other team’s defense. Jordan’s unique technique allowed him to jump in the air and ‘hang’ there that many fractions of a second longer than others. He could pull off dazzling moves that excited fans everywhere and brought many new ones to the sport. It was his almost alien talent that set him apart, landing him a role in the 1996 Looney Tunes movie Space Jam (which earned more than James’ 2021 Space Jam sequel) and making him a global household name.\n",
            "[Doc 395]: If it weren’t for Sean Connery , James Bond – and especially Daniel Craig – wouldn’t be a household name 50-plus years later. With his debut in 1962’s Dr. No , Connery memorably laid the foundation for a 007 that has withstood the test of time. With his rugged good looks, charm and charisma , Connery set the sophisticated style of how Bond looked, dressed, wooed women, drank, used a gun and drove a car. He was playful one minute and ruthless the next; a refined tough guy that also infused the role with wry humor and knowing looks. He went on to star in six more James Bond movies, cementing how we think of the on-screen character. He’s come to represent the epitome of 007, and every other Bond since Connery can’t help but be compared to him. Plus, as portrayed by Connery, James Bond was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.\n",
            "[Doc 382]: In recent years, corporate culture has creeped into some sports leagues. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. Take Scottie Pippen , who, despite being a vital asset that lifted both Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, played most of the 1990s under what is considered one of the worst contracts in NBA history. In fact, some pro athletes in minor league baseball don’t even make minimum wage . This pay gap creates unnecessary tensions within sport teams and is unfair to teammates who sacrifice just as much but for less money.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 887]: Using more replays won’t eliminate controversies from sports, rather they will simply make the controversies different. No matter the sport, replays are not needed for most calls, especially the ones that referees can make easily based on what they saw. Instant replays are needed during questionable incidents when the call is not obvious. However, even in those cases, replays are not necessarily helpful. For example, in “ the Tuck Rule game ,” even after reviewing the incident, officials made the wrong call (after making the right one on the football field…). Replays won’t suddenly make games any fairer.\n",
            "[Doc 376]: Technology has taken over and transformed innumerable aspects of our lives. For example, 80% of the US workforce will have at least 10% of their tasks affected by AI. Using replays in sports is just another aspect in which technology is changing older methods to make things better. In fact, technological developments in sports have exploded in recent years, improving player`s abilities. It`s only natural that the latest technology leap will also increase the use of replays, enhancing the accuracy of referee calls. It`s the natural evolution of sports. Replays are here to make games fairer, and they should be embraced.\n",
            "[Doc 773]: There are countless ways to prevent replays from substantially slowing down games. For instance, replay use can be limited solely to cases which significantly affect match score. Leagues can limit the time allowed for referees to make a decision based on replays, or limit the number of challenges a team is allowed to have during a game. Moreover, technology might be ahead of us. It`s possible that while you’re reading these lines, there are new technologies available that can provide referees with the right call through the use of replays, before they even ask for it. It`s realistic to believe that, soon enough, technology will shorten the time needed to make a decision using replays. Whether through technology use or through limitations set by various professional sports leagues, the use of replays won’t slow sports games substantially.\n",
            "[Doc 112]: Women should be allowed to compete against men in professional sports since, like in men’s sports, only women who are good enough will be drafted to a particular team and will get the chance to play. That’s just the nature of competitive sports. It’s the “natural selection” mechanism of sports that leaves the bad players out, regardless of their gender, physicality, race or religion.\n",

That’s just the nature of competitive sports. It’s the “natural selection” mechanism of sports that leaves the bad players out, regardless of their gender, physicality, race or religion.\n",
            "[Doc 1214]: Sports are one of those rare things in life where perfection isn’t necessary. The imperfections in sports is what makes them so entertaining; it`s what allows teams to score against others; it`s what allows the underdog to win ; it`s what amazes us over and over again. Mistakes are part of a game`s lore. It`s unreasonable to ask for perfection in sports. Referees , like players, are humans who make mistakes, and that`s part of what makes sports so entertaining and, sometimes, even relatable.\n",
            "[Doc 894]: No matter the sport, games often get condensed into one particular moment. While the final score is determined as a result of an entire game, there is always one defining moment during a particular game. Moreover, sometimes that defining moment is the final play, which also determines the winner of the game. Think about the greatest sports’ moments you’ve seen or personally experienced. Now, imagine that those moments were subjected to replays. Puff, that initial magic is gone. Dissecting or questioning these special real-time moments in replays means ruining them for fans.\n",
            "[Doc 3760]: Mind sports play host to some of the oldest games in the world where people have played competitively. For example Chess traces its history extending back to the 6th century and it's modern competitive form began to evolve in the 15th century. Go or Weiqi has a much longer history and again has been played competitively. In addition both of these sports are contested by millions of people. Chess has a following of at around 600 million. While Go was reported to have a following of at least 27 million in 2003 , Given these sports history and number of players isn't it time that they took their place amongst other sports like Wrestling.\n",
            "[Doc 1287]: Umpires are supposed to facilitate a smooth game. When they are the center of attention, it is usually because something has gone wrong. Legendary Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem accurately stated, “The best umpired game is the game in which the fans cannot recall the umpires who worked it.”   The game is supposed to be decided by the feats of the players on the field, not the fallibility of the men in blue. Instant replay will help make this happen. With instant replay, we would not have had Jim Joyce, the umpire who blew Galarraga’s perfect game, holding a tearful press conference apologizing for his missed call. Instead, we would have had images of Galarraga celebrating his historical achievement with his teammates. The latter, not the former, is what baseball is supposed to be about, and what fans want to see. Instant replay will ensure that baseball revolves around the players, rather than the officials.\n",
            "[Doc 637]: Sports are an important social institution. They promote identification and attachment to society while teaching values, like resilience and determination. Sports also promote a healthy society: an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence suggests that engaging in sports activities can prevent chronic diseases and keep people healthier. The Olympics promote sports in the host city and country. During the Olympics, athletes who are usually unknown are put in the spotlight, are widely recognized , and can even become international heroes. This can encourage local kids and athletes to follow their athletic dreams. Moreover, hosting the Olympics increases the importance of and participation in sports – not to mention new sports facilities being built (or old ones being renovated) that will remain after the Games for local use. The combination of these factors leaves a long-lasting positive impact on the host city. Therefore, hosting the Olympics contributes to a more sports-oriented and healthier society on a city and national level.\n",
            "[Doc 863]: In 2019, the average annual income for a US household was $96,955 while the average income of a professional baseball player in the major leagues was around $4.7 million . The rising gap between the average American’s income and a professional athlete’s income might pose a serious threat to sports. With ticket prices gradually rising, not to mention merchandise price tags, sports fans might feel resentful toward funding overpaid athletes. If so, they’ll stop paying to watch or support professional sports teams, leaving the industry in the lurch.\n",
            "[Doc 1390]: There is an old saying ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’. In order for this proposal to be taken into consideration, a problem regarding the world of sports must be identified. Fortunately for sports, it works like a charm. In a great many sports revenues are going up, television rights are being sold for higher prices than ever before and more and more children are enrolling in sporting activities. Despite the global economic slowdown, sports revenues worldwide should grow by about 3.7 percent to $145.3 billion by 2015, according to a research report. Moreover, if we were to introduce this coercive measure, there would be numerous disadvantages without significant benefits. It would make no sense to create purposeless tensions between individuals and sporting federations. It is even more absurd considering that competitions and sporting events wouldn't benefit at all. This is because almost all top sportspeople accept the request to represent their country, and indeed see it as an honour and privilege. Therefore, it would create no advantages regarding the level of the game or increase the spectacle.\n",
            "[Doc 3399]: While sports may be increasingly about money they still are as much about playing well. Sports fans know what their sport looks like when it is played well and if the level of skill involved in playing was declining they would probably pay less attention and so spend less money on the sport. Money therefore acts as an insentive to keep standards of play as high as possible. It is due to this that we begin to have immense amounts of money going around to buy the best players in many sports.\n",
            "[Doc 716]: Many periodic binge-watchers will choose a night with their TV over a night out with friends. A study found that 56% of bingers prefer to watch alone, and 98% of people prefer to watch at home. Netflix also asserts that 84% of pet owners binge-watch with their pets; this is a concerningly high number of people who prefer to binge with their furry friend rather than with other humans. After all, research from Brigham Young University demonstrates that social isolation is a risk factor for having a shorter life, in ways that are comparable to obesity . Separating yourself from the outside world in order to binge-watch, with or without a pet, may be a sign that things have gone too far. New research confirms that Americans are spending less time with friends than they did a decade ago.\n",
            "[Doc 42]: Sports betting is good for the economy. Legalizing sports betting has obviously created huge state tax revenues. More importantly, it has created more tourism to states where betting is legal and jobs (a potential for 100,000 new jobs ), including new roles, content and shows on mainstream sports channels like ESPN. Sources say that overall state tax revenues from sports gambling have jumped from $38 million (2018) to $126 million (2019) to more than $1 billion (2022).\n",
            "[Doc 539]: There are four major television events that people still watch when they’re scheduled to appear. These include the news, sports, interactive shows and event TV series (like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, etc…). The bigger budgets and byproducts of sports events have made the Super Bowl the most watched event in the world. Additionally, WOW moments on popular shows oblige you to watch each episode as it airs, because a minute after the shows end, social media starts discussing what just happened in them. Interactive programming, such as game shows or talent competitions where viewers can vote, answer trivia questions and engage in real time, enhances the TV-watching experience. All of these elements will keep linear television around for the upcoming future.\n",
            "[Doc 650]: Louis Brandeis, an American lawyer and Associate Justice on the US Supreme Court, once said: “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman…” Meaning, legalized sports betting will actually make it harder to fix games. This is because once legalized, sports betting – and advertisements promoting it – will be monitored , and any irregular activity will be easily detected. It is easier to fix games in an unmonitored environment, in which money flows under the radar. Proof of such successful monitoring is the recent suspension of 5 NFL players who were caught violating the league’s gambling policy. Therefore, the common belief that legalizing sports betting will corrupt sports is wrong.\n",
            "[Doc 189]: Choosing between longer games with no referee mistakes or shorter games with controversies and referee mistakes is easy; it has to be the first option, simply because it`s fairer . Professional teams, players and coaches work hard all season (and pre-season) and don’t deserve to be sent home over one bad call . The damage caused by extending sports games by a few minutes is relatively small compared to the damage when a game or even a season is decided over a bad call . Thus, implementing replays is the right thing to do.\n",
            "[Doc 2423]: A June 2011 peer-reviewed study categorized 159 sports as one of three types: combat, independent, or object. Golf is one of 74 independent sports, along with others such as gymnastics, track and field, swimming, speed skating, and surfing. Not all sports have to be object (like football and baseball), or combat (like boxing and karate).\n",

Many sports use instant replay, but the most obvious criticisms of it come from football. But at the same time, it’s important to get the calls correct, especially in huge moments like that Rams-Saints game. In a post made after the game, Irsay said, “I believe we need to institute Instant Replay for all calls, including Penalties, in the last two minutes of All Games.” This is an intriguing idea for tackling the previous issues discussed.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1045]: While the highest paid athletes draw more attention, the truth is that most athletes are fairly paid . Plus, we tend to forget that published professional athletes’ salaries are gross salaries. While these may seem huge, so are the deductions from them. Aside from federal, state and city taxes and pension, which everyone pays, players also need to pay agent fees, a $10,000 union due, and a Jock Tax for each of their away games, among others. Sure, their net salaries may be higher than ours, but they are still lower than we tend to think and much lower than what is published.\n",
            "[Doc 1154]: Professional athletes sacrifice important aspects of their lives, especially their health and family. For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families. More significant, though, is that players put their bodies in danger daily. Physical injury can leave professional athletes handicapped or disabled for the rest of their lives; NFL players who experience multiple concussions can suffer from progressive degenerative disease that causes dementia and depression. Additionally, while most teenagers or college-age students spend their free time studying, working or hanging out, student athletes aiming to qualify for the pros spend all of their free time training. Thus, professional athletes’ salaries are a fair compensation for the countless time and energy they put into training and the huge health risks they take, especially considering that their careers typically end around the age of 35.\n",
            "[Doc 471]: The large amounts of money invested in professional sports in recent years has the potential to drain the true meaning from sports. Given athletes’ large salaries, more youngsters want to become professional athletes – but for the big money, not for the love of the game. This change in purpose has a negative impact on athletes’ ambition to play. Take Albert Haynesworth of the Washington Redskins. Once he signed a $100 million contract with a $44 million guarantee, he had what some consider to be his worst season ever; it seemed like he simply lost interest in the game. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans.\n",
            "[Doc 653]: The mythical status of all professional athletes is long gone. Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods are just a couple examples of professional athletes who are no longer seen as being role models for youngsters. Today, we know much more about our sports heroes’ lives, for better and for worse. This insight has contributed to the erosion of their status as heroes. As athletes’ statuses change, our attitudes toward them do as well. This has led to a growing public understanding and acceptance of athletes who use PEDs. Thus, our criteria for including baseball players in the National Baseball Hall of Fame has softened over the years , allowing for the inclusion of PED users. In fact, some voters don’t feel that they should be passing judgement on players who used PEDs when there are reportedly racists, gamblers and wife beaters in the Hall of Fame.\n",
            "[Doc 159]: People argue that paying collage athletes will help create a sense of financial awareness for them. However, in reality, poor investments, trusting unethical financial advisors and lavish spending habits are some of the main reasons professional athletes find themselves broke after they retire, according to ESPN documentary, “Broke.” Without sound financial education, young college athletes may not be equipped to handle so much money .\n",
            "[Doc 502]: One of the best aspects of college sports is the players’ enthusiasm. Their love and passion for their respective game is admirable and infectious. But, there is a downside to it; in their fervor to play their best, many college athletes suffer serious injuries that sometimes prematurely end their career. Setting aside the disturbing fact that a career-ending injury will stop their scholarship, those college athletes put their bodies at risk of permanent damage, without being paid. Hurting your knee might leave you limping for the rest of your life. Suffering concussions can cause dementia and depression, not to mention CTE . Those college athletes who put their bodies on the line for each training session and game they play deserve to be paid for the health risks they are taking.\n",
            "[Doc 1529]: Just as an employer has a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees, the IAAF has a duty to provide a safe environment for their athletes. The sports medical team is responsible for ‘preventing illness and injury’,  clearly something that is caused by harsh training. As do all those who are involved in sports. These athletes only exist in a professional capacity because bodies created the positions for the athletes to exist. If the world wants to pay people to perform and compete for them, then once that offer is made they have a moral duty to ensure that work is safe, since they are culpable in creating that work. Moreover, we give the IAAF power in the promise that by giving up localised power of judgement over sport, they can better protect athletes and creating a fairer sporting environment. Abusive training methods are a huge failure on the part of the IAAF and as such they must use the most powerful disincentive possible to them.\n",
            "[Doc 382]: In recent years, corporate culture has creeped into some sports leagues. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. Take Scottie Pippen , who, despite being a vital asset that lifted both Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, played most of the 1990s under what is considered one of the worst contracts in NBA history. In fact, some pro athletes in minor league baseball don’t even make minimum wage . This pay gap creates unnecessary tensions within sport teams and is unfair to teammates who sacrifice just as much but for less money.\n",
            "[Doc 1284]: Once some people choose to use drugs to enhance their performance, other athletes have their freedom of choice infringed upon: if they want to succeed they have to take drugs too. Athletes are very driven individuals, who would go to great lengths to achieve their goals. The chance of a gold medal in two years’ time may out-weigh the risks of serious health problems for the rest of their life. We should protect athletes from themselves and not allow anyone to take performance-enhancing drugs. An example of the pressure is cycling.\n",
            "[Doc 275]: An important argument coming from those who oppose paying college athletes is the expected difficulty involved with implementing such a move. The following are just some of the questions that pinpoint the complexities: Who will pay the college athletes? How often will they receive pay? Will there be a salary cap? Who gets paid and how much? Will female college athletes benefit as much as their male counterparts? Theoretically, the athletes to get paid the most should be the ones playing the sports that bring in the big money, namely, men’s college basketball and football players. This is capitalism, and this is how it works in America. Time will tell who ultimately benefits the most from this decision.\n",
            "[Doc 4011]: Historically, some athletes have decided to get an edge against their competition by utilizing illegal substances or have been negatively influences to do so by their social network, trainers, teammates or peer pressure. This goes against the maxim of what healthy competition represents. Council of Europe in the Code of Sports Ethics The potential benefits to society and to the individual from sport will only be maximised where fair play is centre stage. The truth is that whenever doping is discussed the debate is centered around why do athletes fall into the temptation that banned substances represent, but the main reasons why athletes do not cheat are rarely mentioned. Fact is that the main reason athletes choose not to cheat is the risk of being caught, so this leads to the argument that the risk of cheating has to be so big and the consequences so harsh that more athletes will choose to remain clean. Sociologist Howard S.Becker published a classic work in 1963 called Outsiders which illustrates that athletes' main reasons to avoid taking illegal substances hardly ever relate to moral standards or health issues, though they may factor in the decision. The reason for not doping back when the study was made that was given repeatedly was the fear that it would be socially excluding; that it would ruin the athlete's reputation if he or she were caught. The best way to illustrate how the larger risk represented through the removal of all medals to an Olympic Team will further deter the use of banned substances will be to analyze the situation from a trainer's point of view. In most cases, athletes are either recommended to use the substances by their trainers or at least the trainer is aware of the use of said substances. So, if a trainer knows than one of his athlete's does not stand a chance to win, he may support the use of banned substances. However, if that athlete's decision could hurt the entire team, he would prevent it from happening.\n",

Athletes consent to having very harsh training in order to reach the prize, they’re used to putting themselves in extreme discomfort to achieve their goal. To the average person these things may seem abusive but an athlete considers these physical and mental demands differently.

Some of us are more active physically and sports-inclined. With the right amount of government funding, these people do not have to go through the traditional route of getting a tertiary education which may probably work against them. Instead, they could enrol themselves in sporting institutes and become full time athletes. This will provide them with the right platform to develop their abilities further and excel in their chosen field. Subsequently, they can make a career of out sport by being a private coach, fitness instructor, professional trainer and even a professional footballer who earns £80,000 a week!

By forcing companies to raise salaries higher than the output of such jobs, they will be forced to discontinue them.

Low-income workers would be at the highest risk of being fired since their work wouldn’t be profitable any longer.

For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families. The rising gap between the average American’s income and a professional athlete’s income might pose a serious threat to sports. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his 2020 $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. **The Bottom Line:** While it seems like there’s no way to stop such inflated salaries of professional athletes, the repercussions could cause long-term damage to professional sports.\n",

The underlying economic and regulatory forces are certainly different; the NFL enforces a strict salary cap designed to keep competition fair, while soccer operates within a free global market with minimal spending limits. Ultimately, as wage inflation in both the NFL and global soccer continues to disproportionately funnel wealth towards elite athletes, teams are likely to become more financially vulnerable while fair competition will erode. As these superstar quarterbacks are marketed to consumers as the focal point of each game, other players at non-premium positions (running back, linebacker) lose opportunities to earn new contracts as teams structure their budget around their more marketable star quarterback. These oil-state takeovers simply bully smaller teams into losing their best players, ruining the fairness and competitiveness of the game.\n",

            "[Doc 792]: Wenger’s part in Arsenal’s success is overrated. Rather than attributing Arsenal’s achievements to Wenger’s coaching abilities, they should be attributed to the great vision and fantastic work of the board, led mostly by Vice-Chairman David Dean. When Wenger didn’t want to pay more than £8M for Sylvain Wiltord, Dean recruited him for £13M, and Wiltord eventually became an Arsenal star, playing a huge role in the club’s 2001/2002 Premier League victory. It was Dean’s persistence that brought in the star players who made Arsenal so great. Tony Adams, an Arsenal legend and captain, once said: “ Coaching wasn’t Arsène’s strong point .” Wenger’s strength wasn’t in on-field coaching but in identifying and nurturing young talent.\n",
            "[Doc 351]: Arsène Wenger’s old-fashioned managing became out of date in modern soccer. The sport changed in recent decades; the scope and volume of work required from coaches and managers increased. In the past, the two separate functions of coaching and managing were in the hands of one man. However, these two functions have evolved and now require at least two people to handle them individually. While coaches spend more time coaching, general managers are now required to take charge of various issues in the club, much like general managers in the NBA and NFL. But Wenger never accepted this development. Despite the increasing demands of each role, he firmly believed he could take charge of everything himself. The result is a significant failure in both regards.\n",
            "[Doc 1181]: Arsenal is among the very elite of British soccer. The team reached this status mostly due to Wenger. When he arrived at the club, it was an unremarkable upper mid-table team, with no suitable training ground and a terrible sports culture. But Wenger turned the club around and made Arsenal who they are and what they aspire to be: one of the biggest clubs in Europe. The first thing he did was to improve the training facilities and invest in the youth academy. His vision and philosophy allowed Arsenal to recruit fascinating players like Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka at bargain prices. Under him, these players moved mountains. Wenger led Arsenal into the elite of soccer.\n",
            "[Doc 1041]: Most of the voices calling for Wenger’s resignation came from Arsenal fans. There’s nothing new in soccer fans calling for the dismissal of a club coach; it’s part of the game’s nature. It happens often because soccer fans always want more from the team they support. However, the demand to see Wenger leave was based on emotions rather than on realistic thinking . Arsenal’s rivals, like Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, are far richer, and their regularly finishing in the top spots of British soccer is extraordinary. Arsenal fans got used to Wenger leading his team into the top league rankings in the past, so, once the team started losing, they found it hard to acknowledge the fantastic work done by the Frenchman. The way that fans called for him to leave was wrong and ignored his contributions to the club.\n",

When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

Wenger pioneered Arsenal’s purist game philosophy. It still shapes the present team’s style of play. This adventurous gameplay should be appreciated, especially by those who love the beauty of soccer. Even when he is long gone, this way of playing will remain deeply embedded within the club.\n",

The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1369]: The argument that internet news tends to offer small passages of text compared to newspapers is to be liberal with the truth, due to the vast nature of the internet it offers a variety of styles and is arguably more likely to provide longer passages than newspapers as there is not space restriction as there is with newspapers which can only be a certain size, due to advertisements and printing agreements. With the ability to both search for and easily share content via social networks, the argument that newspapers are better as they prevent information overload feels weak because there are many ways in which content can be filtered to ensure that both the news you actually want and the style and perspective you prefer can be easily accessed.\n",
            "[Doc 4062]: Schools are communities that not only emphasize collective learning but also encourage sports and creativity in the form of extra curricular activities; such activities serve as a utility to instill societal values into the next generation. These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",
            "[Doc 350]: Conservatives have long disagreed with the mainstream media’s liberal tilt . But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted. Not only does this stop conservatives from challenging their own perspective , it also limits their ability to persuade and engage others. For instance, while the majority of Americans were taking efforts to ward off exposure to the coronavirus, a small minority ( 12% ), many of whom reportedly watched Fox News, weren’t concerned, mirroring the station’s initial lackadaisical coverage of the pandemic. Having an additional viewpoint is positive but creating a bubble (a phenomenon present on both sides of the partisan divide) is not.\n",
            "[Doc 276]: In the last few years, vast reserves of resources like oil and gas have suddenly been made available due to the creation of cost-effective extraction techniques, like fracking, which are completely transforming the US’s perspective on energy. Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006. This significantly reduced the price of gas and created a huge boom in domestic oil production.\n",

Even if they are associated by sharing a perspective or an aim, this is not a sign of corruption or bias, and it should not enter into the value of a think tank.

            "[Doc 589]: When considering who deserves to be named as “the best tennis player of all time,” gender should be left out of the discussion (although it usually isn’t). In which case Serena Williams would be considered the game’s best player ever. Even Federer himself has acknowledged her dominance in the sport. Case in point: Williams’s record of 23 Grand Slam wins is more impressive than Federer’s 20. No one is close to flirting with Williams’s domination, and she holds a better Slam-Average (Grand Slams entered/won ratio). So, when only referring to men’s tennis, the claim that Federer is the GOAT may be legitimate, although worth a deeper discussion. However, when gender is taken out of the equation, it has to be Williams!\n",

Take tennis for example: Players who are stronger and more physically adept hold an advantage in some areas of the game, but players who are more talented skill-wise are better overall.

Also, nobody who has ever watched Serena Williams play tennis can deny that sheer skill is what has won her 23 Grand Slam titles (although her muscles definitely help). While men and women may differ in physicality, they do not differ in their skills capacity. This is why former tennis star John McEnroe faced backlash in 2017 when he dismissed Williams as the sport’s greatest tennis player and, instead, clarified that she may be the sport’s best female player.

He is the best of his era on hard and grass courts. (He did lose 11 finals to Nadal on clay, which arguably shows that Federer is the second-best on clay when compared only to the Spaniard.) Versatility is what separates Federer from the rest. As mentioned, his one-handed backhand is a classic, and his forehand is one of the greatest shots in tennis , according to Pete Sampras. He controls every element in today’s tennis, such as the backhand smash and skyhook, half-volley and jump smash. And if that’s not enough, he has the character of a champion, as we all witnessed in the 2017 Australian Open final and 2019 Wimbledon men’s semi-finals.\n",
            "[Doc 300]: The one thing that makes tennis players greater athletes than basketball players is that it’s each player for himself or herself on the court. Every sport requires a level of athleticism, but tennis players have to execute their athletic abilities in every single moment of the game, while remaining at the highest level of focus. There are no substitutions, no “weak” moments when the game is played elsewhere or when a teammate takes over control of the game. The combination of the athletic features together with the intensity and mental abilities required to play it alone makes tennis players the best athletes in sports. Just take a look at Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal’s athletic abilities:\n",
            "[Doc 647]: Federer ushered in the golden era of men’s tennis ; he competed against Nadal and Djokovic, two players who have to be included in any GOAT discussion. Moreover, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka are stronger than their three Grand Slam titles (apiece) would indicate. If anything, it’s Federer’s talent that prevented those players from winning more Grand Slams. Federer’s ability is likely what prevented Nadal from holding the record, until recently , for most Grand Slam titles, as much as Nadal’s ability with clay court serves prevented Federer from adding more wins to his record than he already has (excluding Federer’s Wimbledon 2019 semi-final win). The quality and strength of Federer’s competition is unquestionable. In fact, it has been said that Federer’s skills forced his competitors to up their game just to be able to compete with him.\n",
            "[Doc 1039]: Roger Federer dominated the tennis courts between 2003 and 2007, winning 12 out of his 20 Slams. In seven out of those 12 Grand Slams, Federer beat Andy Roddick (who admits he is one of the worst players to ever hold the no.1 ranking), Lleyton Hewitt, Mark Philippoussis, Marat Safin and Marcos Baghdatis, none of who are considered elite players, and who weren’t ranked highly when Federer won against them. The average ranking of the players Federer faced in the finals during those years is 16.3. Back then, Djokovic’s average, for example, stood at 6.5, meaning Federer played against weaker players than Djokovic did in the finals at that time. Federer’s decline in wins coincides with the emergence of Nadal and Djokovic . His impressive record of Grand Slam wins should be attributed mostly to his lack of competition during those earlier years. Since 2007, Nadal and Djokovic have each taken their fair share of Grand Slam titles – though Nadal upped the ante in June 2022 by claiming his record-breaking 22nd Grand Slam title .\n",
            "[Doc 185]: There are few things in sports as aesthetically pleasing and graceful as Federer’s tennis game . At his prime, his flair and creativity were phenomenal, while his movement is economical , in that he doesn’t run as far or as much as his rivals. His single-handed backhand is poetry, a thing of beauty, an all-time classic. In fact, every aspect of his game is executed effortlessly, with much style and grace. American statesman Henry Clay once said: “Statistics are no substitute for judgment.” Following this logic, if Federer’s 20 Grand Slams are not good enough proof that he is the greatest player ever, many can argue that the way he plays is.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 864]: Comparisons across eras are insufficient . Training conditions and methods are becoming more professional as time goes on. Modern equipment and technology provide players with better equipment and different means of playing the game. Moreover, you can`t tell which players competed in a stronger era. For example, can you tell if Federer is better than Rod Laver or Pete Sampras? Sampras competed with stronger players, like Boris Becker , Andre Agassi and Pat Rafter. Laver dominated the game no less than Federer, winning 11 Grand Slams despite the fact that he was not allowed to compete for five years in the middle of his career. It can’t be said conclusively that Federer is the best player to ever play the game—therefore, it shouldn’t be said.\n",
            "[Doc 3497]: People keep saying 'Tennis, Cricket and Rugby have GLT' Firstly, that doesn't mean they have made their game more just....as indeed it is not applied at all levels of the game, and it is only applied for some issues, also, it is just a case of changing the rules for the elite when they had the same standard before. When two teams no the rules, i9t doesn't matter what the standard and criteria is as long as its the same for both, so it does not bring in any change in such a status of justice applied to the game. However, the more important point, is that football is a flowing game, where in theory, the ball could stay in play for 45mins without any stoppage at all. As for Tennis and Cricket then by necessity they must continuously stop, scoring in them is also continuous. They are games of stops and starts. Rugby, relatively is also a game of continuous stops and starts, due to the nature of tackling in rugby and how it is dealt with. Tennis is all about whether the ball is 'in' or 'out'. This is not the case with football, a goal can be rare, and the main factor in football is not whether the ball was over the line, rather in most cases a goal is known to clearly cross the line, it will usually remain in the net or obviously cross it. The main factor in goals being score is the play that leads to them and not the actual final stage of the ball crossing the line.\n",
            "[Doc 1279]: Technology has been proven to work across a wide range of sports from tennis, cricket and rugby. A survey of its implementation in the 2011 Australian Open demonstrates the impact that guaranteeing correct decisions had on several games.1 It has become a natural aid to sport. GLT would only be used on a goal decision, much like tennis uses challenges only once a rally has stopped. Football is no more fluid a sport than any of the others. If a debatable goal were scored, play would stop anyway while one team celebrates and the other protests to the officials.\n",
            "[Doc 1224]: While Jeter may have made some flashy plays with the glove, defensive metrics overwhelmingly suggest that the Gold Gloves he was awarded were undeserved. Jeter’s defense cost the Yankees 246 runs defensively compared to the average player at his position, according to Baseball-reference.com, making him the worst of any player in history . And Bill James , a baseball statistician, called Jeter “the most ineffective defensive player in the major leagues, at any position.” While Jeter never made a ton of errors, he simply did not have the range of his fellow shortstops. Jeter was among the best in history with the bat – but in the field, he was at best below average .\n",
            "[Doc 817]: In terms of being a team player, there is no comparison between Kobe and LeBron. The latter is a smart player and fantastic passer , with a vision of a crafty point guard. He can create a shooting opportunity for himself in every position but will happily pass the ball if his teammate has a better shot. In contrast, Kobe was thought of by many as a selfish player , who hurt his team’s harmony, as was pointed out in the Phil Jackson biography . Kobe was ambitious but also arrogant in a way that led him to make bad on-court choices more than once. In contrast, LeBron’s teamwork and leadership shined after he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers, taking them to four playoffs in his first four years. His leadership skills have since gotten stronger since joining the LA Lakers in July 2018. Lifting up one’s team is the mark of a great player.\n",
            "[Doc 3491]: Tennis and cricket are allot faster sports which are allot harder to judge. For instance in tennis there is mainly just the one question. Did the ball cross the line or not. In football there are two. Did it cross the line and Did it cross the line by fair means or foul. It would be unfair to answer just one of of those questions with technology but to leave the other unanswered. To answer both questions you would have to video everything that went on before the goal which would not be enjoyable. Limited challenges are also unfair because if, after judicial use of your allowances, you spot horrendous foul, your stuck.

The latest headlines show the Patriots’ receiver, Antonio Brown being accused of multiple incidents of alleged sexual assault. He is by no means the only one . In the summer of 2014, after being accused of mishandling the infamous Ray Rice incident, in which the Baltimore Ravens player was caught on video beating his then-fiancé, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new league policy to punish any player involved in domestic violence or sexual assault with a six-game suspension without pay. However, it was inconsistently reinforced, and even updated in 2016 with more loopholes. Since then, the NFL appears to have softened its stance, enforcing the six-game suspension against only two of 18 players publicly linked to domestic violence allegations. In response to its inconsistent and flippant attitude toward stemming domestic violence, fans ( 24% of those surveyed) are abandoning the NFL.\n",

However, if the team fails to put a decent product on the field it will have a substantial impact on that organizations profits. It is rare for bad teams to draw decent crowds. Nobody wants to tune in everyday to watch their favorite team get beat, again. There are a few teams in baseball that have a rich history, and draw well regardless of how the team is doing, but they are the exception. Even if the team is bad, and a certain player is excelling, it is beneficial. If a statistical milestone is close to being achieved, or a rookie player is having an incredible year, it helps to put fans in the stands. It obviously would help with TV ratings, jersey sales, concessions, and ticket sales, etc. For the player, quality performance may help land an endorsement deal or a big contract once they hit the free agent market.\n",

            "[111/185] Summarizing: Should College Athletes Get Paid?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 275]: An important argument coming from those who oppose paying college athletes is the expected difficulty involved with implementing such a move. The following are just some of the questions that pinpoint the complexities: Who will pay the college athletes? How often will they receive pay? Will there be a salary cap? Who gets paid and how much? Will female college athletes benefit as much as their male counterparts? Theoretically, the athletes to get paid the most should be the ones playing the sports that bring in the big money, namely, men’s college basketball and football players. This is capitalism, and this is how it works in America. Time will tell who ultimately benefits the most from this decision.\n",
            "[Doc 113]: College is about preparing oneself for real life. It is supposed to provide students with tools and abilities to succeed after college. In that manner, college athletes are no different than other college students who practice or inten in hospitals, law firms or advertising agencies for little to no money. So why should athletes be get paid while the others don’t? A lot of young adults today are impatient and lack the ability to delay gratification. College can teach them a great life lesson: in real life, you have to work hard and wait for your chance. Paying big money to any college student, athlete or academic is far from being the ideal preparation for life.\n",
            "[Doc 502]: One of the best aspects of college sports is the players’ enthusiasm. Their love and passion for their respective game is admirable and infectious. But, there is a downside to it; in their fervor to play their best, many college athletes suffer serious injuries that sometimes prematurely end their career. Setting aside the disturbing fact that a career-ending injury will stop their scholarship, those college athletes put their bodies at risk of permanent damage, without being paid. Hurting your knee might leave you limping for the rest of your life. Suffering concussions can cause dementia and depression, not to mention CTE . Those college athletes who put their bodies on the line for each training session and game they play deserve to be paid for the health risks they are taking.\n",
            "[Doc 132]: It`s common to think paying college athletes can detract from the purity of the game and ruin that magic. But it won`t . Fans’ passion and loyalty for their favorite college team(s) and player(s) won’t be diminished by money. College athletics has always generated big money . Companies have long profited off of branding college athletes, namely, asking them to wear brand apparel during games without paying them to do so. As such, these players have felt used.\n",
            "[Doc 1045]: While the highest paid athletes draw more attention, the truth is that most athletes are fairly paid . Plus, we tend to forget that published professional athletes’ salaries are gross salaries. While these may seem huge, so are the deductions from them. Aside from federal, state and city taxes and pension, which everyone pays, players also need to pay agent fees, a $10,000 union due, and a Jock Tax for each of their away games, among others. Sure, their net salaries may be higher than ours, but they are still lower than we tend to think and much lower than what is published.\n",
            "[Doc 159]: People argue that paying collage athletes will help create a sense of financial awareness for them. However, in reality, poor investments, trusting unethical financial advisors and lavish spending habits are some of the main reasons professional athletes find themselves broke after they retire, according to ESPN documentary, “Broke.” Without sound financial education, young college athletes may not be equipped to handle so much money .\n",
            "[Doc 471]: The large amounts of money invested in professional sports in recent years has the potential to drain the true meaning from sports. Given athletes’ large salaries, more youngsters want to become professional athletes – but for the big money, not for the love of the game. This change in purpose has a negative impact on athletes’ ambition to play. Take Albert Haynesworth of the Washington Redskins. Once he signed a $100 million contract with a $44 million guarantee, he had what some consider to be his worst season ever; it seemed like he simply lost interest in the game. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans.\n",
            "[Doc 1154]: Professional athletes sacrifice important aspects of their lives, especially their health and family. For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families. More significant, though, is that players put their bodies in danger daily. Physical injury can leave professional athletes handicapped or disabled for the rest of their lives; NFL players who experience multiple concussions can suffer from progressive degenerative disease that causes dementia and depression. Additionally, while most teenagers or college-age students spend their free time studying, working or hanging out, student athletes aiming to qualify for the pros spend all of their free time training. Thus, professional athletes’ salaries are a fair compensation for the countless time and energy they put into training and the huge health risks they take, especially considering that their careers typically end around the age of 35.\n",
            "[Doc 1284]: Once some people choose to use drugs to enhance their performance, other athletes have their freedom of choice infringed upon: if they want to succeed they have to take drugs too. Athletes are very driven individuals, who would go to great lengths to achieve their goals. The chance of a gold medal in two years’ time may out-weigh the risks of serious health problems for the rest of their life. We should protect athletes from themselves and not allow anyone to take performance-enhancing drugs. An example of the pressure is cycling.\n",
            "[Doc 653]: The mythical status of all professional athletes is long gone. Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods are just a couple examples of professional athletes who are no longer seen as being role models for youngsters. Today, we know much more about our sports heroes’ lives, for better and for worse. This insight has contributed to the erosion of their status as heroes. As athletes’ statuses change, our attitudes toward them do as well. This has led to a growing public understanding and acceptance of athletes who use PEDs. Thus, our criteria for including baseball players in the National Baseball Hall of Fame has softened over the years , allowing for the inclusion of PED users. In fact, some voters don’t feel that they should be passing judgement on players who used PEDs when there are reportedly racists, gamblers and wife beaters in the Hall of Fame.\n",
            "[Doc 4011]: Historically, some athletes have decided to get an edge against their competition by utilizing illegal substances or have been negatively influences to do so by their social network, trainers, teammates or peer pressure. This goes against the maxim of what healthy competition represents. Council of Europe in the Code of Sports Ethics The potential benefits to society and to the individual from sport will only be maximised where fair play is centre stage. The truth is that whenever doping is discussed the debate is centered around why do athletes fall into the temptation that banned substances represent, but the main reasons why athletes do not cheat are rarely mentioned. Fact is that the main reason athletes choose not to cheat is the risk of being caught, so this leads to the argument that the risk of cheating has to be so big and the consequences so harsh that more athletes will choose to remain clean. Sociologist Howard S.Becker published a classic work in 1963 called Outsiders which illustrates that athletes' main reasons to avoid taking illegal substances hardly ever relate to moral standards or health issues, though they may factor in the decision. The reason for not doping back when the study was made that was given repeatedly was the fear that it would be socially excluding; that it would ruin the athlete's reputation if he or she were caught. The best way to illustrate how the larger risk represented through the removal of all medals to an Olympic Team will further deter the use of banned substances will be to analyze the situation from a trainer's point of view. In most cases, athletes are either recommended to use the substances by their trainers or at least the trainer is aware of the use of said substances. So, if a trainer knows than one of his athlete's does not stand a chance to win, he may support the use of banned substances. However, if that athlete's decision could hurt the entire team, he would prevent it from happening.\n",
            "[Doc 1529]: Just as an employer has a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees, the IAAF has a duty to provide a safe environment for their athletes. The sports medical team is responsible for ‘preventing illness and injury’,  clearly something that is caused by harsh training. As do all those who are involved in sports. These athletes only exist in a professional capacity because bodies created the positions for the athletes to exist. If the world wants to pay people to perform and compete for them, then once that offer is made they have a moral duty to ensure that work is safe, since they are culpable in creating that work. Moreover, we give the IAAF power in the promise that by giving up localised power of judgement over sport, they can better protect athletes and creating a fairer sporting environment. Abusive training methods are a huge failure on the part of the IAAF and as such they must use the most powerful disincentive possible to them.\n",
            "[Doc 1532]: Sport is dominated by a male-orientated world view. This is the case in two respects: This male dominated world-view is unfair on female athletes. Sport is supposed to be a celebration of the human mind and body, and it is right that athletes that push themselves to the brink in search for glory receive due praise. The hugely skewed coverage of sport against women’s sports caused by the male world-view in the media is hugely unfair on female athletes, as they do not get the deserved recognition their male counterparts receive.\n",
            "[Doc 533]: If salaries were to replace scholarships in college sports, athletes may not earn much more. Let’s say for the sake of argument that, for example, an impressive $100,000-a-year salary for a college athlete would grant him only a few hundred dollars more per year than a scholarship. Let’s just estimate that a full athletic scholarship at an NCAA Division I university is about $65,000 a year. This includes tuition, room, board, and books (if you enroll at a college with high tuition). In contrast, a salary will be subjected to federal and state income taxes. Therefore, out of the $100,000, a net of $65,100 would remain for the student. The difference is marginal.\n",
            "[Doc 382]: In recent years, corporate culture has creeped into some sports leagues. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. Take Scottie Pippen , who, despite being a vital asset that lifted both Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, played most of the 1990s under what is considered one of the worst contracts in NBA history. In fact, some pro athletes in minor league baseball don’t even make minimum wage . This pay gap creates unnecessary tensions within sport teams and is unfair to teammates who sacrifice just as much but for less money.\n",
            "[Doc 761]: While many argue that a college degree may no longer be enough or even the only way to get you in the door of an office, the opportunities you take advantage of on a college campus could make or break a company’s decision to hire you. From writing for the school paper to interning in a biotech laboratory or volunteering to do admin work of a cherished organization, the world of potential job experience is open on college campuses in a way it may not be once you graduate. Not only that, but you can also meet professionals and mentors who are important in and to your field of choice. Networking with influential professors or industry leaders as an enthusiastic student can lead to advantages later on when it comes time to secure a job. The industry-related activities and connections available to you in college are rare and can strengthen your skill set and open opportunities in a way that will make you stand out in the eyes of a future employer.\n",
            "[Doc 2972]: Taking council tax into account and assuming you are eligible for a reasonable amount of benefits, a job on minimum wage is probably not going to be as much money as full benefits unless you work very long hours. On the other end of the spectrum, students from families that can financially support them for a while would be advised to put off finding employment in order to look for a better paid job. Taking any job only works for those actually in financial trouble. People being paid wages aren't self-sufficient, they're just dependent on an employer rather than the Government. You don't have to be paid to benefit society, you can volunteer. Many voluntary jobs help far more people than paid jobs that could just have been created to keep people in employment. Presuming you care about your role as a cog in a machine.\n",
            "[Doc 585]: Basketball players combine a wide range of athletic abilities. While hockey and soccer players might be faster, and NFL football players might be stronger, it can be argued that basketball players are better all-around athletes. After all, they demonstrate great endurance as they run up and down the court, playing both offense and aggressive defense. They’re strong and possess an impressive amount of speed and agility . And, of course, they possess amazing jumping ability. The wide range of their athletic abilities makes them the most versatile athletes in sports, thus the best athletes.\n",
            "[Doc 1101]: In America, college graduates earn around $22,000 more annually compared to those with only a high school degree. If you have the chance to get a degree, take it; it can help you advance in life. Perhaps education should be a basic right, but unfortunately, the dire lack of schooling for people around the globe paints a very different picture. For millions, primary education isn’t even an option , let alone higher education. In fact, around 60 million children across the world are prevented from going to elementary school each day, which cancels their possibility of attending college. There are many people worldwide who die never having turned the page of a book. So, if you are one of the fortunate people that can afford a college education, there are millions of people who would tell you not to take the opportunity for granted.\n",
            "[Doc 468]: Paid maternity leave sounds good for women, but it can actually harm their job prospects. Businesses may not like to admit it, but they would be less likely to hire women of child-bearing age just to avoid facing the extra cost of paying their maternity leave. People argue that discrimination laws would prevent this from happening, but it’s often almost impossible to prove why a company hired one person rather than another. Alternatively, all women would end up being paid a lower wage to balance out the expected cost of maternity leave. Paid maternity leave would be especially unfair on women who don’t have children, who would be paid a lower wage without even getting the benefit of taking leave.\n",

The primary financial compensation student athletes receive is a scholarship that pays all or part of their tuition and other college-related expenses. Division III sports programs do not award sports scholarships, although other forms of financial aid are available to student athletes at these schools. The NCAA imposes strict rules for recruiting student athletes and provides a guide to help students determine their eligibility to play college sports. Once a student has received a scholarship offer from a college or university, the person may sign a national letter of intent (NLI), which is a voluntary, legally binding contract between an athlete and the school committing the student to enroll and play the designated sport for that school only.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 552]: MMA gets a bad rep from the intensity of the fights, which often get bloody. However, a University of Alberta study found that it is actually safer than boxing. While MMA fighters are more likely to get cuts and bruises, boxers have a higher chance of suffering from head trauma, one of the most dangerous injuries. In fact, the blood often seen in MMA is caused by blows to the nose or facial cuts, which tend to look much worse than they are. Unlike other athletes that compete very regularly, MMA fighters only get into the ring between one and five times year . Training happens in very safe conditions, making serious injury very unlikely. In comparison, football players play around 17 games a season. With the number of collisions and tackles in each game, their risk of a serious injury is much higher than in MMA.\n",
            "[Doc 1006]: MMA fighters face a raised chance of injuries to spinal cords, cuts and fractures. Many former fighters end up with major, life-changing damage. According to this study , 23.6%, which is almost one in four, of MMA fighters receive at least minor brain damage. Moreover, a Cleveland Clinic study found that the longer an MMA fighter’s career lasted, the more prone they were to suffer from measurable brain damage, like CTE . The repeated blows to the head and elsewhere so often seen in MMA fights pose a clear risk to players’ long-term health.\n",
            "[Doc 499]: In MMA, regulatory bodies constantly make sure that fighters’ safety is upheld, whether that be before, during or after their fights. This stands in stark contrast to other sports that celebrate and strongly encourage participants to push through injuries . Meanwhile, in MMA, fighters go through a thorough examination before every fight that ensures they are physically ready. This procedure and commitment to safety has led to last-minute match cancellations throughout the years. Most recently, MMA legend Connor McGregor was forced at the last minute to pull out of the UFC 303 due to injury. Such cancellations have surely cost organizers quite a bit of money but demonstrate how important safety is in MMA.\n",
            "[Doc 915]: When judging whether a sport is dangerous, we also need to look beyond the ring. In MMA, fighters brawl with great aggression, punching and kicking each other while locked in tight cages with nowhere to run. Sports have always had a strong influence on young people, who idolize athletes and emulate them. Promoting these vicious fights doesn’t seem healthy for society. At the end of the day, MMA is about beating other human beings into submission or worse, unconsciousness. Additionally, many fighters have been accused of domestic abuse and assault yet still kept their jobs. Conor McGregor’s punches sent the person playing the Miami Heat’s mascot to the ER in a marketing gimmick gone wrong. Previously, he punched an old man in the head for refusing an offer of whisky. Despite both encounters, he has continued to be a part of, and profit from, MMA.\n",
            "[Doc 393]: With its focus on short, high-intensity exertion, MMA is a great workout to improve cardiovascular health, gain strength and lose weight. Unlike swimming or running, for example, MMA is a complete body workout. It also burns more calories than most other sports. This study found that it noticeably boosted weight loss compared to judo or Jiu Jitsu. And MMA isn’t just an amazing workout for the body but also for the mind. Besides increasing confidence and reducing stress, its demanding nature has been shown to boost concentration . There are immense holistic health benefits to this sport.\n",
            "[Doc 1028]: MMA is different from other fighting sports due to its intense use of kicks. The force that can be gained with one kick is far greater than any punch. In MMA, kicks to most body parts, including the head, are allowed. When they connect well, they can be incredibly devastating as can be seen here . This kind of impact can cause immense trauma to the head and brain, resulting in some serious damage. Kicks are part of sports like Taek Wondo or Jiu Jitsu, but they are less dangerous in those sports due to fighters wearing head protection or kicking less frequently. The ability to kick also resulted in some MMA fighters aiming for their opponents’ knees , often with the intent to bend them in and break them, known as the “ oblique kick .” There needs to be a line between healthy athletic competition and causing terrible long-term injuries.\n",
            "[Doc 2943]: It is a disgrace...a blood lust. Anyone who denies it is being less than truthful. The whole point is to submit the opponent in a violent manner..choke, knock out, TKO, etc, and lots of blood is spilled in the process. Boxing is the same really. Sports that display skill and toughness, such as amateur wrestling, would not bring in the big dollars because they don't result in a bloodied and humiliated opponent. Hence, society demands more brutality. C'mon folks...be truthful... MMA is just another reflection of the decline of society.\n",
            "[Doc 4049]: There are too many prisons as it is. They are too comfortable and free easy living full of too many returning short term offenders.

If we protect our children from the harmful effects of drugs, we should be protecting them from getting shot as well. Allowing one and not the other is hypocrisy - and since letting 16 year olds drink legally would be a less-than-sensible idea, we should ban the armed forces from recruiting in schools.\n",
            "[Doc 2842]: The government shouldn't waste their time interfering in what should be an individual's responsibility. We all know that going too fast is dangerous and that if we cause an accident while driving we will be severely punished for it. Everyone is taught this while they learn to drive. Surely if you are mature enough to drive a vehicle then you are mature enough to weigh this up for yourself and follow the rules of the road. Speed cameras just catch people out who accidentally go a tiny amount over the limit, not causing any harm to themselves or others.\n",
            "[Doc 2138]: Personal autonomy has to be the key to this debate. If people want to smoke – and the owner of the public place has no issue with that – it is not the role of the state to step in. While smoking is dangerous, people should be free in a society to take their own risks, and live with their decisions. All that is required is ensuring that smokers are educated about the risks so that they can make an informed decision.\n",

            "[Doc 2958]: When a person brings children into this world, adopts or assumes care for a child, they should be able to do everything possible to protect them. This cannot be done if there is a dangerous sex offender living next-door, who has slipped past the police and is in a position to abuse your child. Children are the most precious things in the world, the future of tomorrow. It is our duty to take care of them. Donald Findlater, of the child protection charity Lucy Faithfull Foundation, added: “The biggest risk to children is not from the registered sex offender who the police know and are managing; it is from the sex offender who is not registered and who no one knows about.”(1) In light of this, it seems more than reasonable that a parent should be able to ask the police to check records of someone who they think might be potentially dangerous. Surely it cannot be breaching an individual’s human rights for information on any violent or sexual crimes that may have been committed, in contrast with the safety of a child.\n",
            "[Doc 3529]: They will spend their time after leaving school trying to earn their Fathers love and therefor not being true to themselves. They will go for money for example and not choose a career that will be compatible with who they truly are. This will lead to unhappiness, depression and hyper sanity (through intense education - learning too much too soon).\n",
            "[Doc 2830]: Currently too many people drive. There are too many cars per household and too many people drive for short journeys. Appealing to people's inner eco-fighter is clearly not working. The continually rising price of petrol has also had little effect on people's driving habits. Drivers would rather make cut back elsewhere than on their driving costs. Because the transport system is so inefficient. There are not enough convenient stations. There is not enough reliability in public transport. The conditions are not sufficient. These three issues need to be addressed in order to prevent people from driving and save the environment. The NO side is right to say that we are in a serious crash of the economic system. But this is not an argument against mass transit. People are not lazy because they drive; they are faced with jobs and stores which are too far and unaccessible by mass transit, in its current pathetic state. Government priorities are certifiably psychotic: spending most tax money on predatory war and ways to police people when they desperately step over legal boundaries to stay alive, but on the other hand lie prostate when corporations and banks steal billions, and spend a token to fulfill their mandates of \"providing for the common welfare\" (which I assume is in most constitutions). The pitiful state of mass transit is just one telling sign that people everywhere have no say in their governance.\n",

            "[Doc 1840]: The usefulness of landmines is significantly over-represented.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 326]: Magic’s regular season stats are fantastic but don’t differ significantly from Larry Bird`s stats . Per game, Bird scored 24.3 points, picked 10 rebounds, and delivered 6.3 assists. In comparison, Magic`s stats are 19.5, 7.2 and 11.2, respectively. However, Magic’s playoff stats are better. During the playoffs, while Bird scored 0.5 less points per game, Magic delivered one more assist and picked 0.5 more rebounds per game. Meaning, Magic always performed better during playoff time, when the money was on the table, as proven in game 6 of his rookie season. This is why he has two more championships over Bird.\n",
            "[Doc 56]: Larry Bird played with a group of players whose collective talent was no way near the talent level of Magic`s teammates. Magic played with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , arguably the best center to have ever played the game, and with James Worthy , a No. 1 draft pick, three-time NBA champion, and one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history. Bird, himself, is what made the Celtics great. With Bird, the Celtics shot from 29 wins to 60 wins in a regular season. His spirit and mentality positively affected the entire team. This is not to say that his teammates were bad players, but Robert Parish , Dennis Johnson and Cedric Maxwell , to mention a few, were not as talented as the Lakers’ players at that time. Bird had less to work with, and without him, the Celtics would probably be a mediocre team, which cannot be said about Magic.\n",
            "[Doc 1088]: There are few basketball players who are as memorable as Magic Johnson . Magic was a one-of-a-kind basketball genius: a 6-foot 9-inch Point Guard (PG), with amazing offensive capabilities. He was known for his absolute control of the ball, his brilliant passes and, especially, for his trademark “no-look” passes (video to follow). His flashy, “street-ball” style of play was artistic and inspirational. Even today, he is considered one of the most gifted players in the history of the game. Magic put the showtime in the “ Showtime Lakers ” of the 80`s. They were one of the most fascinating and mythical teams, mostly due to Magic`s style.\n",
            "[Doc 942]: Stats prove that both players were complete players, meaning both did well in most aspects of the game (such as scoring, rebounding, assists), each in his own way. For instance, Magic with fewer points and rebounds on average, Bird with fewer assists. The only aspect of the game in which the two truly differ was defense. Bird`s cutthroat competitive drive made him one of the best defensive players of his times. He was chosen three times for the NBA All-Defensive Team (while Magic was never chosen) and was considered as a tough and relentless defender .\n",
            "[Doc 884]: Hustle Statistics refer to the intangible actions taken by a player during games. It quantifies the effort-based activities in basketball, in both defense and offense. Action like drawing, charging from the opponent, jumping for loose balls, contesting an opponent’s shots, and more, are considered hustle plays. Bird is one of the greatest hustle players to ever play the game. He was an inspirational hustle player, whose smarts and immeasurable intangibles augmented his fantastic tangibles. So, although Magic’s and Bird`s stats slightly differ, Bird’s hustle plays put him on top.\n",
            "[Doc 521]: Bird may have been an amazing small forward, but he was a rather conventional one. Magic, on the other hand, revolutionized the point guard position and the game itself. Back in those days, the dichotomy was clear: If you`re a tall player, you`re a forward and play like a forward, meaning that you play closer to the rim, concentrate on rebounding, and rarely dribble. Magic changed that: He was a tall all-around point guard who handled the ball with great talent, passed it perfectly, took it to the rim, and rebounded. He paved the way for today’s all-around players, like Kevin Durant and LeBron James . Moreover, Magic marked the transformation of the game from a solid half-court game to one played on a full court, on the run, and above the rim.\n",
            "[Doc 3097]: It is a mish-mash of cobbled together rules from different languages with as many exceptions as there are words that obey the rules. People argue over the rules constantly and very few people know them or use them correctly. In many cases, such as inflammable vs. flammable, disorient vs. disorientate, the correct version sounds more awkward than the incorrect version. How can it be said to be a good thing to follow a system that doesn't work?\n",
            "[Doc 177]: While Kobe fans argue that he was a better clutch player (the one who makes the most important shots, especially in the game’s last minutes) than LeBron, this claim is far from reality. LeBron, who does not choke, is a better clutch player , and this argument is backed by stats . A look into Kobe vs. LeBron regarding clutch-time stats proves LeBron is better than Kobe was in the most important time of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 11]: Auerbach had a special eye for discovering rising stars and building a winning team out of them. He pushed hard for Bill Russell in the 1956 NBA draft, seeing huge potential in his defensive qualities. Russell became a key part in the team’s ability to stop opposition advances and then start their own counterattacks. Molding young players in the ways he saw fit, Auerbach offered a springboard to players like John Havlicek, who then became the engine behind many of the championships they won together. In 1978, it was Auerbach’s vision that drove the Celtics to draft Larry Bird, who was still relatively unknown. He turned out to be one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen. Auerbach’s negotiation skills were key here as they gave him an edge in getting the players he wanted.\n",
            "[Doc 742]: The NFL draft is about making choices, which is always a question of alternatives. When picking Russell, the Raiders could have chosen Calvin Johnson, who was a great option and was considered as one of the most dynamic receivers in the league for a decade. Potential future Hall of Famers Joe Thomas (who is in the College Football Hall of Fame ), Adrian Peterson and Patrick Willis were alternative choices for Russell. The Chargers’ choice of Leaf is more understandable. During the 1998 draft, the Chargers needed a QB. They preferred Peyton Manning (who is considered one of the best QB of all times), but he was chosen first by the Colts. The Chargers were left with Leaf, who was then considered around the same level as Manning . So, the Raiders had better options and yet made the worst choice, which makes Russell a bigger bust.\n",
            "[Doc 3045]: Firstly, all education is not the same. I is an huge over generaliztion to simpy say all education good even within a context of university. For we may learn false or fallacious knowledge or simply bad knowledge. For arguing through a Graduate level framework. I take pleasure every few day to watch something benificial before bed. What I recognize of even the most educational shows they are benificial only to a very general understanding of the topic. Channels such as the history channel are hardly historical and even when they are they are careless to speak with enough accuracy to discriminate between very unliklyness and truth claims. There is often a motivation to make certain topics more exciting but often with the cost of oversimplification. Moreover in attempt to reach greater audiences shows are capped at a intellectual capacity of the casual person. But for a deep level of understanding books can be particularly selected to meet the optimal requirements for the learner. For there may be use in learning basic generals of a topic. But the computer really is the better source then both books or tv. especially with the increase of e-books and the ability to select for individual capacities. But books inable to reader to learn at thier own pace and process information at a pace best for them, while a tv show requires less effort. the learner loses information when attemping to contemplate over a concept of interest for they either miss the continuing the information or do not fully benifit at the from absorbtion of information caused by deeper processing. One of the intuitive motivation for tv vs books is the effort required vs pleasure recieved. For just like any new system of understanding such as learning a new language or learning to type.. once the skill is mastered the effort required for value drops thus increasing the motivation to take advantage of the new skill. thus mastery of reading increases the rate you of value you get out of reading vs the effort put in.. That is for the unpractised reader may be more motivated for tv then books. But as you become more skilled the more you reading becomes valuable. So we may understand that the novice reader cannot percieve the value of reading from a frame work of ignorance. this is not to be taken in an evaluative meaning but rather a descriptive explanation.\n",
            "[Doc 516]: During searches, Amazon users get the added bonus of being presented with similar products or products frequently purchased together. This makes Amazon’s comparison-shopping of brand vs. brand or product vs. related product fast and effortless. Another benefit of shopping on Amazon is the immediacy in which purchases are received. With services like Amazon Prime, the customer journey of “search – select – pay – possess” is near-instantaneous. Since Amazon delivers nearly two-thirds of its own orders directly to consumers, it’s no wonder that the company is giving UPS and FedEx a run for their money, competition that will only benefit consumers. It’s much faster than most other e-commerce stores. This benefit was appreciated during the pandemic lockdowns, as with efforts to combat price gouging.

This means the bullying is likely to be more intense than when it is done in real life.

            "[Doc 398]: Life is a marathon , but minority runners often start the race from further back than do whites. The fact is that people are not born onto even playing fields, and race often widens the divide between competitors. Affirmative action is a kind of compensatory justice , by making up for America’s history of racial discrimination and giving minorities a leg up. This was President Johnson’s thinking when he signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act , allowing African Americans to exercise their right to vote. As he stated : “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race, and then say, ‘You are free to compete…’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” This policy helps give minorities the necessary boost to bring them to the starting line where privileged people already stand.\n",
            "[Doc 484]: While the musical version is a fun, electrifying show, a feast for all senses that captivates its audience with (26) songs and spectacle , the movie is driven, instead, by the story and character development. The themes of family, fate, and aging, not to mention courage vs. fear, (and let’s not forget the hint of incest) have a more meaningful punch in the movie in a way that evokes identification and empathy.\n",
            "[Doc 465]: After refusing to be drafted to Vietnam, Ali was stripped of his world title and got suspended for 3.5 years by the World Boxing Federation. When he returned in 1970, heavyweight boxing had already entered what is considered as its golden era. That era included all-time greats like Joe Frazier, George Forman, and Larry Holmes. Not only did Ali adjust himself to that era, he was the best in it. He beat Forman and Frazier (twice) and held the title for around five years.\n",
            "[Doc 2312]: Although the issue of the impact on bird populations has been somewhat exaggerated there is no doubt that wind farms has an impact on bat populations and some impact on birds . Wind farms impact on migratory routes as they need to be based in areas where there is little human habitation or activity. This is simply humans as a species taking over land which has been the preserve of other creatures which already have few enough areas to live in, away from the voracious implications of human consumption.\n",

            "[Doc 246]: A theory endorsed by both Bill Nye the Science Guy and Neil deGrasse Tyson , evolution is on the side of the egg as coming before the chicken. This is because there was once a proto-chicken – a bird resembling a chicken, but not quite of chicken status – that went about its business laying and fertilizing an egg. However, this egg carried some sort of genetic mutation that turned it into the chicken we have now come to know and love. Because the parents of the first chicken egg were birds that weren’t yet chickens, it appears that the egg did, indeed, come first. In addition, eggs of other birds predated chickens by millions of years, and there are fossils to prove it. The Archaeopteryx – largely accepted as the world’s oldest and first bird , and the closest living being of ancient times to resemble a chicken – left behind fossils from 150 million years ago, give or take. So, in comparison to other types of birds, chickens came rather late to the evolutionary party.\n",

            "[114/185] Summarizing: Muhammad Ali – He Was Great, but Was He the Greatest?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 762]: Being deemed the greatest should solely be about Ali’s boxing abilities. However, people confuse those with his out-of-the-ring deeds. Ali changed the world . He was a freedom fighter who fought against racism . He also had unparalleled charisma and charm. He was a master of self-promotion and smart enough to know how to use the media for his purposes. This made him loved by fans and the media for his brave and picturesque figure. All of this created a mythical figure. Ali`s image was one of an undisputed champion, a person larger than life. However, that doesn’t mean he was the greatest boxer. He himself once noted that, pound for pound, Sugar Ray Robinson was better.\n",
            "[Doc 227]: Despite his contributions to racial equality, it’s worth noting that Ali’s out-of-the-ring persona was far from impeccable. He had a tendency to swim against the current a bit too far. Some of his quotes and remarks were on the verge of racism ; one such example is “my enemy is the white people, not the Vietcong.” Ali was also vain. He declared himself as the greatest boxer (when he was still Cassius Clay), and was quoted numerous times saying how good, beautiful and talented he was. Amid his showman -like traits, he also disrespected his opponents. Sure, it’s part of boxing psychology, but, at times, he took it too far. Before one of their fights, he said: “Joe Frazier is an Uncle Tom. He works for the enemy.” He also referred to Frazier as an ugly man who “should give his face to The Wildlife Fund.” Great sportsmen should respect their opponents.\n",
            "[Doc 1042]: Toughness was one of Ali’s main attributes. It’s best expressed in his extraordinary ability to take a punch. No one knew how to take punches like Ali did, which takes courage and commitment. His epic “ Rumble in the Jungle ” fight against George Forman is the best example of his toughness. Forman was one of the strongest punchers in the history of boxing. During their fight, Ali adopted the “ rope a dope ” tactic, where he allowed Forman to take shots at him just to tire Forman out. Ali took punch after punch, only to take Forman down in the eighth round. That fight, which is widely regarded as the 20th century’s biggest sports event, fixed Ali’s position as the toughest and greatest boxer of all time.\n",
            "[Doc 3054]: He was given the password by his wife and the laptop was shared. He had permission to use the email account.\n",
            "[Doc 465]: After refusing to be drafted to Vietnam, Ali was stripped of his world title and got suspended for 3.5 years by the World Boxing Federation. When he returned in 1970, heavyweight boxing had already entered what is considered as its golden era. That era included all-time greats like Joe Frazier, George Forman, and Larry Holmes. Not only did Ali adjust himself to that era, he was the best in it. He beat Forman and Frazier (twice) and held the title for around five years.\n",
            "[Doc 1183]: Ali was a great boxer who had a huge impact on American society, but his boxing stats prove he wasn’t the greatest boxer. Ali won 56 out of his 61 fights, and 37 of them were knock-outs. While these are great stats, other boxers had better: Harry Greb won 262 fights (!), Sugar Ray Robinson won 173, and Harry Armstrong won 150. Rocky Marciano didn’t lose a fight. In a sport like boxing, the scope of the fights makes a huge difference, since every fight is injurious and risky. A closer look at the boxing stats of Armstrong and Robinson proves that they fought stronger fighters than Ali did, relative to their weight at the time.\n",
            "[Doc 3110]: A prison can't hold him - he is far too resourceful, he would find a way to break out straight away, or his corporation would bail him out. He is too dedicated to be persuaded to stop. Even if you could press charges against his corporation, it is huge, it wouldn't bankrupt him. Even if there was some way to persuade him to stop - someone killed him, or came up with a better solution that he would actually accept - he is protected by narrative causality. He would just survive due to Plot happening, or someone would replace him, or some other plot device that keeps the story going. He is designed to be a main character of a long-running series, he doesn't just go away.\n",
            "[Doc 682]: “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” is Ali`s most famous quote . More than anything, this quote reflects his unique and remarkable boxing style . Ali wasn’t boxing; he was dancing in the ring. He moved like no other heavyweight boxer moved or will move. The combination of his heavyweight body, speed and reflexes was revolutionary and made his boxing style artistic. He not only introduced new techniques in the ring but also a level of elegance that changed heavyweight boxing and made him world champion three times.\n",
            "[Doc 1085]: Contrary to Snowden’s claim about wanting to stand up for his fellow Americans, the information he leaked actually created more harm than good . The majority of the information that he shared is about the U.S. spying on foreign nations and not its domestic operations. As such, he risked damaging America’s relationship with foreign countries. By doing so, Snowden not only undermined U.S. alliances around the world but also U.S. efforts to undermine enemies that operate in countries where citizens have less ability to protect themselves from tyranny. If he had been a true patriot interested in protecting the American constitution, as he claims he is, he would have focused on collecting and leaking only the information that documented the NSA’s overreach in domestic spying operations.\n",
            "[Doc 669]: Messi is not only an incredible scorer and gifted playmaker, he also makes everyone around him a better player. A true leader, he brings his team together. Not only does he have more assists and key passes than Ronaldo, he is always using his phenomenal vision to keep his teammates involved. He has great tactical intelligence, finding free spaces to move into, receiving the ball and then laying it off to a team-mate, to build attacks. While Ronaldo is more of an executor, who plays high up the pitch and scores great goals when given the chance, Messi, who can do that just as well, is also comfortable dropping deep and keeping possession of the ball with his team. From these positions, he can send his colleagues on dangerous runs with pin-point passes, like he did in the 2022 World Cup game against Croatia . This versatility makes him that much better than Ronaldo.\n",
            "[Doc 1132]: Think about the last time Kanye came up in a conversation; it’s not just his music that gets people talking. His long history of speaking (or tweeting) very openly in public and saying just about anything that comes to mind are particularly well-timed when he needs to get back into the spotlight. Though it’s hard to beat his recent controversies, specifically his sporting a “ White Lives Matter ” shirt followed by anti-Semitic social media posts , probably his most famous outburst was in 2009 at the VMAs , which will always be remembered as the time he ruined Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech, making it all about him. He used the VMAs as his stage again six years later, when he went on a 20-minute rant saying he will be running for president in 2020 – which he made official on July 4, 2020. That same month, in an anti-abortion rant, he raised eyebrows when disclosing to the public that he and his ex-wife had initially considered aborting their first child. He has also publicly admitted to having an opioid addiction, and claimed black people “chose” slavery . As a result, the public finds itself talking oh-so-much about the versatile rapper – but for the wrong reasons. Instead of discussing his music, we are left to judge his impulsive antics and an over-inflated ego.\n",
            "[Doc 33]: Columbus’s accomplishments were not owing to his capabilities but to his penchant for ineptitude and miscalculation . Columbus’s initial mission was to discover an express route to Asia via the Atlantic. For reasons which are obvious today, Columbus never did discover such a route, nor did he discover the gold, gems, or spices that he’d promised in abundance to his Spanish patrons. He had no talent for geography . Columbus insisted Cuba was Japan and then China . He was convinced that the Bahamas were islands off the coast of India (hence, the geographical misnomer “West Indies”). Even his first colony was established by default when he was forced to leave behind castaway crewmen from his wrecked flagship Santa Maria .\n",
            "[Doc 2732]: There is a recognised shortage of front-line, hands-on practitioners, in the form of plumbers, electricians, service men and women (police, fire and medical), etc. This, coupled with a demonstrable shortage of engineering, mathematics and science graduates, produces an over-population of humanities and media graduates who may have been better suited to other professions or workplaces. For some reason, academic achievement is considered more important that engaging in a career that you want, or that you are exceptionally well-suited to. When he was a child, he was told \"You can do better than that\", meaning he could do a 'proper' job, by getting a 'proper' education. But he wanted to be a fireman. When he saved the life of his teacher and his teacher's wife, he said \"I hope he thinks better of me now\". We should encourage people to follow careers that they enjoy or are well-suited to, or both - not just assume that a university education is the paramount achievement. What is the ultimate outcome of a perfect education? University professors; not valuable services. We do not realise how many fantastic gardener's, artists, writers and eletricians and service men we are losing because of the pressure society put into the individual to sign up. This is because everybody thinks that it is easier to become enrolled into a university.\n",
            "[Doc 1446]: The Order had been made in the youth's absence without his being able to give his side of the story (one of the main concerns about ASBOs and one that can lead to misuse). The day after the Order was made someone came to his house to \"serve\" it on him. This consisted of his being handed a copy of what was a fairly bulky document running to several dozen pages with no attempt to explain it or even to ascertain if he was literate enough to read it. The Order included an restriction preventing him entering a particular estate nearby and another preventing him from associating with certain others. Unfortunately, he went out before reading the Order and beached it twice that day. The next day he went out again and breached it three times by mistake as he had not read the part covering the particular restriction. He now faces possibly custody although he has never been convicted of a criminal offence.” The issuing of ASBOs is inconsistent and almost amounts to a geographical lottery. People can be jailed for breaching an ASBO where the original offence was itself non-imprisonable – i.e. A civil procedure is being used to create and expand criminal sanctions. ASBOs have also been imposed on people with mental health problems where treatment would have been more appropriate.\n",
            "[Doc 687]: LeBron might be more dominant player, but Kobe was a more versatile and well-rounded player, which gives him the edge in this debate. While LeBron is an all-around player, with explosive power that makes him almost impossible to guard, he lacks instinct and on-court elegance and style. In comparison, Kobe was a virtuoso on offense, a better finisher and a better defender. He also had amazing anticipation and instincts that were perfected with Phil Jackson’s triangle offense. The Phoenix Suns’ forward, Grant Hill, who guarded both players, told Sports Illustrated : “He [LeBron] has the two pitches… both of them are great. But Kobe is like the guy with all the pitches. He brings his fastball, his change, gives you something on the corner… With Kobe, you’re never comfortable.” When it comes to Kobe vs. LeBron, the latter is great but the former was something truly special.\n",
            "[Doc 28]: Although everyone on both sides agrees that all lives matter, the “ All Lives Matter ” slogan is frequently used to hijack and undermine the BLM message in favor of other people. When a #BlueLivesMatter hashtag was added to support policemen, it was used to oppose #BlackLivesMatter.” This was further shown in 2016 when 10,000 people protested in support Peter Liang, a Chinese-American policeman who was jailed for killing Akai Gurley, an unarmed Black man. Many of Liang’s supporters shouted, “All Lives Matter,” claiming that he was a scapegoat because he was not white and that he should not be jailed. However, Black activists pointed out that Liang was tried by a jury of his peers and deserved to be jailed for his actions. Using “All Lives Matter” to demand freedom for someone who was convicted of murdering an unarmed Black man is nothing more than demanding that white privilege be extended to all people of color except for Black Americans.\n",

            "[Doc 749]: Aside from creating jobs for around 100K people worldwide , Musk has put his own money on the line to ensure his employees continue to have jobs. In fact, he invested $20 million into saving Tesla after it was on the cusp of bankruptcy in 2015, and he has never taken a paycheck from the company. Additionally, $100 million of his own money went into funding SpaceX – a risky investment, as the space industry had never been privatized before. He has quietly donated to charities and has reportedly pledged to give away at least half of his money when he dies. More recently, he has made his Starlink technology available to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\n",
            "[Doc 556]: If Snowden had been a patriotic whistle blower, he would have first found legal avenues for his pursuit in reigning in the NSA. For instance, he could have appealed to members of Congress, who are elected to represent the American people. Instead, he went straight to largely foreign journalists and newspaper editors and burdened them with the responsibility to decide which of the stolen documents should be kept secret and which should reach the public domain. Snowden may have argued that he was acting nobly, but it was actually careless, as journalists and their editors aren’t qualified to decide such legal matters, especially when their interests are about selling newspapers, not protecting U.S. national security.\n",

That came the following year, when heavyweight champion Sonny Liston agreed to fight Ali. The challenger geared up for the bout with a litany of insults and rhymes, including the line, \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.\" He beat the fearsome Liston in a sixth-round technical knockout before a stunned Miami Beach crowd.

            "[115/185] Summarizing: Kobe VS LeBron – who is considered better?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 177]: While Kobe fans argue that he was a better clutch player (the one who makes the most important shots, especially in the game’s last minutes) than LeBron, this claim is far from reality. LeBron, who does not choke, is a better clutch player , and this argument is backed by stats . A look into Kobe vs. LeBron regarding clutch-time stats proves LeBron is better than Kobe was in the most important time of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 687]: LeBron might be more dominant player, but Kobe was a more versatile and well-rounded player, which gives him the edge in this debate. While LeBron is an all-around player, with explosive power that makes him almost impossible to guard, he lacks instinct and on-court elegance and style. In comparison, Kobe was a virtuoso on offense, a better finisher and a better defender. He also had amazing anticipation and instincts that were perfected with Phil Jackson’s triangle offense. The Phoenix Suns’ forward, Grant Hill, who guarded both players, told Sports Illustrated : “He [LeBron] has the two pitches… both of them are great. But Kobe is like the guy with all the pitches. He brings his fastball, his change, gives you something on the corner… With Kobe, you’re never comfortable.” When it comes to Kobe vs. LeBron, the latter is great but the former was something truly special.\n",
            "[Doc 927]: When Kobe played, he had a better supportive team around him, both on the court and in the coach position. Three out of Kobe`s five rings were won together with Shaquille O’Neil , possibly the best center to ever play the game. Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, although none of them is a hall-of-famer, make a fantastic supportive team. Moreover, Kobe won his five rings with former coach Phil Jackson , who many argue is probably the sharpest basketball mind to ever exist. Meanwhile, LeBron won his first two rings as part of the Miami Heat`s trio. Aside from Dwayne Wade, LeBron’s supportive team lacked the quality that Kobe`s support had. LeBron won his championship third ring against a team that scored the best regular season record ever. LeBron won the finals’ MVP award and was the most dominant player in every championship he won. He might have fewer championship rings than Kobe had, but he played a bigger part in achieving them.\n",
            "[Doc 2]: A huge part of Michael Jordan`s legacy was earned on the day he won game five of the 1997 finals in Utah , when he dropped 38 points (including a clutch 3-pointer) with flu-like symptoms, including an extremely high fever. This is what makes a legend. Similarly, Kobe took over game four in the 2000 finals with an injured ankle. He also won finals with a damaged index finger. His work ethic and ambition were inspiring. He was a rip-your-heart-out-and-watch-it-beat-in-his-hands kind of player, regardless of his physical condition. While LeBron can demolish every opponent, many argue that his spirit is different than Kobe’s. It is thought that LeBron lacks the magic touch that Kobe possessed, which sets a player apart from the rest. The ability to perform when it matters most, against all odds, which Kobe did repeatedly, defines real legends.\n",
            "[Doc 963]: Defense wins titles. Sure, you have to be a good offensive team, obviously, but in the nerve-racking finals , having a better defensive team has, historically, made winning the title more likely. In the Kobe vs. LeBron debate, both players were/are huge talents with enormous offensive abilities. While LeBron was named six times in the NBA All-Defensive team , Kobe was named 12 times in the NBA All-Defensive team. The latter’s defensive contribution was key in breaking up opponents’ movements and starting counterattacks. This diverse skill set gave him more of an ability to lift up his team in any stage of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 817]: In terms of being a team player, there is no comparison between Kobe and LeBron. The latter is a smart player and fantastic passer , with a vision of a crafty point guard. He can create a shooting opportunity for himself in every position but will happily pass the ball if his teammate has a better shot. In contrast, Kobe was thought of by many as a selfish player , who hurt his team’s harmony, as was pointed out in the Phil Jackson biography . Kobe was ambitious but also arrogant in a way that led him to make bad on-court choices more than once. In contrast, LeBron’s teamwork and leadership shined after he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers, taking them to four playoffs in his first four years. His leadership skills have since gotten stronger since joining the LA Lakers in July 2018. Lifting up one’s team is the mark of a great player.\n",
            "[Doc 3097]: It is a mish-mash of cobbled together rules from different languages with as many exceptions as there are words that obey the rules. People argue over the rules constantly and very few people know them or use them correctly. In many cases, such as inflammable vs. flammable, disorient vs. disorientate, the correct version sounds more awkward than the incorrect version. How can it be said to be a good thing to follow a system that doesn't work?\n",
            "[Doc 303]: They say you`re as good as your weakest link. The 1984 draft had no weak links. Who could be considered the weakest link there exactly? John Stockton , the league leader in assists and steals to this day? Or Sir Charles (Barkley ), who was one of the greatest rebounders of his time? The 1996 draft had far more weaker links, especially compared to Barkley or Stockton. Steve Nash was considered as a lesser version of Stockton, and a far worse defensive player. Allen Iverson is considered one of the most talented players ever, but he never fulfilled his potential. Kobe Bryant was a phenomenon, but if you consider players like Markus Camby, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, or Stephon Marbury of the 1996 draft, this one had weaker links.\n",
            "[Doc 742]: The NFL draft is about making choices, which is always a question of alternatives. When picking Russell, the Raiders could have chosen Calvin Johnson, who was a great option and was considered as one of the most dynamic receivers in the league for a decade. Potential future Hall of Famers Joe Thomas (who is in the College Football Hall of Fame ), Adrian Peterson and Patrick Willis were alternative choices for Russell. The Chargers’ choice of Leaf is more understandable. During the 1998 draft, the Chargers needed a QB. They preferred Peyton Manning (who is considered one of the best QB of all times), but he was chosen first by the Colts. The Chargers were left with Leaf, who was then considered around the same level as Manning . So, the Raiders had better options and yet made the worst choice, which makes Russell a bigger bust.\n",
            "[Doc 4033]: If we are mature and can make our own life decisions on our own, we should be considered legal.\n",
            "[Doc 1140]: The NBA has changed in recent years. Today, the game favors speed and shooting. This change didn’t occur out of nowhere – it happened after a new era of players with greater physical and athletic abilities arrived in the league. NBA players now combine height together with shooting abilities and speed (which was considered rare only 15 years ago). Also, as basketball became faster, players needed to develop more endurance. Given that some players shoot from such a large distance away from the basket (like the late Kobe Bryant did, and today’s Stephen Curry still does) that some suggest moving the 3-point line back or even applying a 4-point line . This is an example of how basketball players’ athletic abilities have gotten significantly better, which can’t be said for athletes in any other sport.\n",
            "[Doc 3045]: Firstly, all education is not the same. I is an huge over generaliztion to simpy say all education good even within a context of university. For we may learn false or fallacious knowledge or simply bad knowledge. For arguing through a Graduate level framework. I take pleasure every few day to watch something benificial before bed. What I recognize of even the most educational shows they are benificial only to a very general understanding of the topic. Channels such as the history channel are hardly historical and even when they are they are careless to speak with enough accuracy to discriminate between very unliklyness and truth claims. There is often a motivation to make certain topics more exciting but often with the cost of oversimplification. Moreover in attempt to reach greater audiences shows are capped at a intellectual capacity of the casual person. But for a deep level of understanding books can be particularly selected to meet the optimal requirements for the learner. For there may be use in learning basic generals of a topic. But the computer really is the better source then both books or tv. especially with the increase of e-books and the ability to select for individual capacities. But books inable to reader to learn at thier own pace and process information at a pace best for them, while a tv show requires less effort. the learner loses information when attemping to contemplate over a concept of interest for they either miss the continuing the information or do not fully benifit at the from absorbtion of information caused by deeper processing. One of the intuitive motivation for tv vs books is the effort required vs pleasure recieved. For just like any new system of understanding such as learning a new language or learning to type.. once the skill is mastered the effort required for value drops thus increasing the motivation to take advantage of the new skill. thus mastery of reading increases the rate you of value you get out of reading vs the effort put in.. That is for the unpractised reader may be more motivated for tv then books. But as you become more skilled the more you reading becomes valuable. So we may understand that the novice reader cannot percieve the value of reading from a frame work of ignorance. this is not to be taken in an evaluative meaning but rather a descriptive explanation.\n",
            "[Doc 1580]: What matters for a state when it comes to foreign policy, and therefore with helping to circumvent censorship, is whether the policy is considered legitimate domestically. Since a government's legitimacy is domestically derived from the support of its people if they support the policy then it is legitimate. While it is often not considered a top priority people in democracies usually support promoting human rights and spreading democracy around the world.\n",
            "[Doc 516]: During searches, Amazon users get the added bonus of being presented with similar products or products frequently purchased together. This makes Amazon’s comparison-shopping of brand vs. brand or product vs. related product fast and effortless. Another benefit of shopping on Amazon is the immediacy in which purchases are received. With services like Amazon Prime, the customer journey of “search – select – pay – possess” is near-instantaneous. Since Amazon delivers nearly two-thirds of its own orders directly to consumers, it’s no wonder that the company is giving UPS and FedEx a run for their money, competition that will only benefit consumers. It’s much faster than most other e-commerce stores. This benefit was appreciated during the pandemic lockdowns, as with efforts to combat price gouging. Being the market leader means that the standard Amazon adopts becomes the market standard, which, in turn, benefits all consumers. This can also be seen with Amazon’s PillPack acquisition , which highlights how its embrace of disruptive competition is a good thing for consumers.\n",
            "[Doc 1551]: When internet anonymity is used for bullying, it can make the situation much worse. Firstly, perpetrators are much less likely to hold back or be cautious as they are less concerned with the possibility of being caught. This means the bullying is likely to be more intense than when it is done in real life. URL:  https://sites.google.com/site/cyberbullyingawareness/traditional-bullying-vs-cyberbullying ‘The Problem of Cyberbullies’ Anonymity’.\n",
            "[Doc 484]: While the musical version is a fun, electrifying show, a feast for all senses that captivates its audience with (26) songs and spectacle , the movie is driven, instead, by the story and character development. The themes of family, fate, and aging, not to mention courage vs. fear, (and let’s not forget the hint of incest) have a more meaningful punch in the movie in a way that evokes identification and empathy.\n",
            "[Doc 3709]: If school was optional it would make life better.\n",
            "[Doc 1348]: Anorectic patients are typically treated under mental health legislation (e.g. the UK 1983 Act). They do not make a free choice because they are not rationally able to weigh up decisions and consequences, they ‘feel’ fat when they obviously are not and are irrational as they are willing to starve themselves to the point of death when suicide is not their intent. There have been court cases that have confirmed that force feeding should be allowed when a patient is considered mentally ill. For example the case of “ B  vs.   Croydon Health Authority ” in 1994 it was judged, that B (a borderline personality disorder patient, which involves suffering from an irresistible desire to inflict-self-harm) can be force fed, even though she did not give consent to the treatment. The court explained that because she was not aware of the seriousness of her condition and she had found it difficult to break out of the cycle of self-punishment, she was deemed unfit to make decisions about her nutrition.\n",
            "[Doc 3141]: Childrens' main role models are either their parents, their teachers, each other, or other adults they see on TV. If you want children to behave better, you need to act better.\n",
            "[Doc 1600]: The information trail left online through cookies etc. is a public statement, put into the public sphere. Provided the individual's identity is not revealed the information is usable through the impermeable intermediary of security settings, etc. Thus, firms and others interested in the data get information about users without ever being able to ascertain the actual identity of those individuals, protecting their individual privacy. Furthermore, this sort of targeted advertising, while focusing on general demographics and programmes, does succeed in hitting its mark most of the time. Thus, there is a value in having the programming, and it is absent stereotype. All of this advertising is simply the continuation of firms’ and organisations age-old effort to better understand their clients and to cater for their needs and should not be considered any differently to adverts being placed as a result of working out what programs are watched by what demographic. TV is also moving towards targeting ads to individuals through information such as household income and purchasing history, this is information that is not private and online usage should be considered the same way.\n",

            "[116/185] Summarizing: Are the 1991 Washington Redskins the Best NFL Team Ever?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 203]: The 1991 Redskins are the best team the game has ever seen mostly because they were one of the most balanced and varied Super Bowl winners . They were not about stars who shine and carry the team to glory; they were about hard-working, modest team players, who all played for one cause: winning. Together, they formed a whole that was bigger than the sum of its part . It is their team spirit that allowed them to dominate an NFL.\n",
            "[Doc 543]: The 1991 Redskins finished their regular season in a fantastic 14-2 record. That record , together with their three wins in the NFL playoffs that year was made against the league’s toughest competition at that time. The Redskins’ opponents during the 1991 season had a collective record of .500 or better. There have been very few teams throughout NFL history that have played such a difficult schedule and played so remarkably despite of it. They won their first 11 games and lost only two games by a combined five points!\n",
            "[Doc 1053]: The 1991 Redskins hold some of the most impressive stats in NFL history, proving just how incredible their team was. First, they led the league in points (485 points scored) while their defense allowed only 224 points (the second fewest in the league). Second, as previously stated, they lost only two games (one of them after assuring first place) during the regular season by only a combined five points. Third, they held a 75-point playoff margin (102-27), one of the best in football history (a margin that wasn’t achieved when their win was in their hands). Above all stands one fact that highlights just how good this team was: Both offensively and defensively, the Redskins had +43 sack ratio, while their QB was sacked only seven times throughout the entire season!\n",
            "[Doc 1141]: An old cliché says that defense wins championships in footbal l, mostly because a first-class defense is almost impossible to beat during playoff s. If so, and if the strongest football team ever should be determined by the quality of defense, it has to be the 1985 Chicago Bears. The 1985 Chicago Bears were notorious for their impenetrable revolutionary defense, which played together from 1984 to 1986. They went 15-1 in the 1985 season, and won that year’s Super Bowl while setting an NFL record for 72 sacks, allowing only 10 points during the playoffs. The next year, they set a then-NFL record (for a 16-game season), allowing only 186 points and losing in the playoffs only to the upcoming champions, the Washington Redskins.\n",
            "[Doc 290]: Football is a quarterback’s game, and the 1989 San Francisco 49ers had Joe Montana , probably the game`s most legendary quarterback. The 1991 Redskins had Mark Rypien who, with all due respect, was not on the same level as Montana. Additionally, the 1989 San Francisco 49ers were one of the few teams to win two consecutive championships, with an impressive 55-10 win against a Denver Broncos (which was quarterbacked by a future Hall-of-Famer) in Super Bowl 1989. And there is more: Much like the 1991 Redskins, the 1989 San Francisco 49ers lost only two games by a total of five points. Their offense, led by Montana and the legendary wide receiver Jerry Rice , was exhilarating, finishing first in the NFL in scoring (27.6 points per game).\n",
            "[Doc 603]: Though overshadowed by widespread negative coverage, the NFL’s national anthem protests have led to positive developments. At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice.\n",
            "[Doc 209]: Like it or not, NBA basketball is a game of super stars. Players have a substantial impact on the game, their team, and even on their team`s squads and managerial decisions. Their egos are huge, and rightfully so, because during the money time, it`s them out there; they take the shots, and they take the blame for missed shots. Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever. Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton are Hall of Famers who were THE superstars of the golden era. Until today, they are considered as one of the best in their positions. The 1984 draft had the biggest star quality ever and should be considered the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 1136]: Over the last decade, fantasy football is to thank for the soaring and sustained popularity of the NFL. Fantasy sports has become a massive $7 billion dollar industry ; the Fantasy Sports Trade Association estimates that of the 59 million people in the United States and Canada who play fantasy sports, 80% are playing fantasy football. People bet big money to be in fantasy football leagues and therefore have a lot riding on each NFL game. Therefore, they enthusiastically tune in to watch each of their players throughout the NFL season, even if their actual team is less than stellar. That fantasy football has become so mainstream and so intertwined with NFL football means that the latter will continue to remain as popular as ever.\n",
            "[Doc 778]: Once considered a great unifier of American society, NFL football suddenly became a political and social divider in the summer of 2016. That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest. For many , NFL games – and post-game analyses – no longer provide an escape from draining politics but have turned into an unwelcome extension of it.\n",
            "[Doc 4012]: We believe individual sanctions are not working. Sanctioning the whole team will substantially improve the status quo. Today, tests are done randomly or in cases of suspicion (i.e. when records are broken), so for athletes that choose to use prohibited substances the worst-case scenario is to get caught and bear the responsibility of their actions themselves. But if we increase the cost of getting caught by punishing their olympic team, the individual athletes who used to use these substances would have to face harsher consequences both for themselves and their team if he/she is caught. They will have to face condemmnation by the team, probably have fights with their teammates, and the fact that they ruined the team's performance will give them a huge burden to carry throughout their entire life and will negatively effect their reputation with the fans. For instance, if a soccer player during a match is tempted to commit a gross foul during the game, and he knows he could be expelled for such an action, maybe he would not mind doing so, if for him it is not a big deal to stop playing. But since expulsion means the team will play with 10 players instead of 11, he knows such an action would bring a negative effect for the whole team, so this pressures him into being more careful not to break the rules, because his actions could punish the whole team. Therefore, teammates will be angry at the individual who committed the gross foul and would blame him for the problems he created for the entire team. So, this policy creates peer pressure. Athletes working within a team, will want their teammates to behave properly and not to consume prohibited substances. If those who do not use drugs did not care in the past about whether or not their teammates used drugs or not because that was \"their own business\", will now be forced to care since they could be affected. So now everyone is pressing drug-users to stop consuming them, because now it is everyone's business.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 471]: The large amounts of money invested in professional sports in recent years has the potential to drain the true meaning from sports. Given athletes’ large salaries, more youngsters want to become professional athletes – but for the big money, not for the love of the game. This change in purpose has a negative impact on athletes’ ambition to play. Take Albert Haynesworth of the Washington Redskins. Once he signed a $100 million contract with a $44 million guarantee, he had what some consider to be his worst season ever; it seemed like he simply lost interest in the game. Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans.\n",
            "[Doc 4013]: This debate is about whether the teammates hold the responsibility for one teammate’s wrongdoings. The whole team doesn’t win when one person does a good job; for the same reason, we believe the WHOLE team cannot lose because one person did something bad. Why should we punish people who have earned medals when one team member makes a bad decision that others didn’t or might’ve not known about? It was the athlete’s decision and s/he should be held responsible for his/her actions, not the teammates. Like we’ve mentioned in previous arguments, proposition had a fallacy in their argument that this motion would create social pressure as it was based on a heavy assumption that these teammates knew what was happening at all times. This assumption fails to apply to all of cases and also does not explain why the teammates deserve to be stripped of their medals if they were to deserve the medals as any other athletes who played accordingly to the regulations. Even if teammates knew, this wouldn’t necessarily cut down motivation for the athlete to stop dope usage because their motivation solely depends on winning, and they will instead try to hide the fact they are doping from their teammates which can actually increase negative health risks as prop is concerned about. Also, we have to consider the alternate athletes of the team. The motion does not deal with Olympic participants, but team members. We should be aware that a team is often made up of the number of people they require plus an alternate. An alternate athlete is given the opportunity to participate in a competition when the main athlete gets injured or sick; they may not play in the game but are still considered as a member of a team. Alternate athletes may not even participate in the game, but for the fact that they used dope, they have the potential to ruin their whole team’s career. With this in mind, it is evident that punishing the entire team is unjustifiable.\n",
            "[Doc 323]: Long before Colin Kaepernick took a knee, the NFL was dealing with another scandal involving a number of its players perpetrating domestic abuse . The latest headlines show the Patriots’ receiver, Antonio Brown being accused of multiple incidents of alleged sexual assault. He is by no means the only one . In the summer of 2014, after being accused of mishandling the infamous Ray Rice incident, in which the Baltimore Ravens player was caught on video beating his then-fiancé, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new league policy to punish any player involved in domestic violence or sexual assault with a six-game suspension without pay. However, it was inconsistently reinforced, and even updated in 2016 with more loopholes. Since then, the NFL appears to have softened its stance, enforcing the six-game suspension against only two of 18 players publicly linked to domestic violence allegations. In response to its inconsistent and flippant attitude toward stemming domestic violence, fans ( 24% of those surveyed) are abandoning the NFL.\n",
            "[Doc 3398]: Team owners are often more concerned about the bottom line than winning championships. However, if the team fails to put a decent product on the field it will have a substantial impact on that organizations profits. It is rare for bad teams to draw decent crowds. Nobody wants to tune in everyday to watch their favorite team get beat, again. There are a few teams in baseball that have a rich history, and draw well regardless of how the team is doing, but they are the exception. Even if the team is bad, and a certain player is excelling, it is beneficial. If a statistical milestone is close to being achieved, or a rookie player is having an incredible year, it helps to put fans in the stands. It obviously would help with TV ratings, jersey sales, concessions, and ticket sales, etc. For the player, quality performance may help land an endorsement deal or a big contract once they hit the free agent market.\n",
            "[Doc 927]: When Kobe played, he had a better supportive team around him, both on the court and in the coach position. Three out of Kobe`s five rings were won together with Shaquille O’Neil , possibly the best center to ever play the game. Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, although none of them is a hall-of-famer, make a fantastic supportive team. Moreover, Kobe won his five rings with former coach Phil Jackson , who many argue is probably the sharpest basketball mind to ever exist. Meanwhile, LeBron won his first two rings as part of the Miami Heat`s trio. Aside from Dwayne Wade, LeBron’s supportive team lacked the quality that Kobe`s support had. LeBron won his championship third ring against a team that scored the best regular season record ever. LeBron won the finals’ MVP award and was the most dominant player in every championship he won. He might have fewer championship rings than Kobe had, but he played a bigger part in achieving them.\n",
            "[Doc 963]: Defense wins titles. Sure, you have to be a good offensive team, obviously, but in the nerve-racking finals , having a better defensive team has, historically, made winning the title more likely. In the Kobe vs. LeBron debate, both players were/are huge talents with enormous offensive abilities. While LeBron was named six times in the NBA All-Defensive team , Kobe was named 12 times in the NBA All-Defensive team. The latter’s defensive contribution was key in breaking up opponents’ movements and starting counterattacks. This diverse skill set gave him more of an ability to lift up his team in any stage of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 899]: Professional sports is a money-earning business. Sports teams know that to stay profitable they need to win, which is why they sign the best players available. Quality superstars, or “franchise players ,” are the face of the team. They make their teammates better, thereby improving the whole team (think Tom Brady Kevin Durant , and, of course, Michael Jordan , etc.). This leads to more wins and, in turn, more viewers, more merchandise sold and increased brand worth. Usually, a team has one franchise player, who makes a huge salary, arguably more than his projected value, since he drives the team’s business profitability forward. The amount of money that team owners are willing to pay franchise players often comes at the expense of the other players. However, with fans willing to pay more than 100% premiums on tickets to see individual players, like LeBron James, franchise players have extra responsibility to live up to their star power. They also have the celebrity effect, which draws more paying fans in. Therefore, they deserve to earn more.\n",
            "[Doc 541]: To many fans, the fact that 43-year-old Tom Brady abandoned the New England Patriots after 20 years for Tampa Bay Buccaneers represents the end of a dynasty . While the Patriots were victors in Super Bowl 53, their defeat the previous year against the Eagles, a team that had never before won a Super Bowl , restored hope to NFL fans everywhere that anything is possible, and that underdogs can – and do – win. The Eagles’ surprise win that year meant that team ranking does not predetermine the Super Bowl teams or champion. This, plus Brady’s departure from New England returned an air of excitement and unpredictability to the NFL, which re-energized fans, old and new alike. Not to mention that Patrick Mahomes , the youngest quarterback to ever be named a Super Bowl MVP, recently just signed a record-breaking contract extension worth $503 million. It’s a new era, indeed.\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1071]: Historic NFL teams with great defense, like the 1984 Chicago Bears or the 2015 Denver Broncos , are rare and therefore more memorable than teams with great offense. They demonstrate and validate the virtues of defense, which are often overlooked. This brings many sports figures (from players to commentators) to glorify defense and to believe that it wins NFL championships. While great defense has won championships for certain NFL teams, it doesn’t mean that defense always leads to championship victories. The main difference is that because the importance of offense in football is obvious, it isn’t as glorified as defense. But this doesn’t mean that offense doesn’t win championships or that defense more often wins championships.\n",
            "[Doc 41]: First-class NFL defenses , with an elite coach, are nearly impossible to beat. No matter the sport, defensive plays can create a huge psychological impact on the opponent`s offense; they put great pressure on opponents and can frustrate them. A brilliant defensive strategy can change the course of the game, whether football, basketball or soccer. In fact, the importance of a great defense in football is much like its importance in basketball, or the importance of the goalie in hockey and in soccer. A team just can’t win games or championships without defense; it`s part of the nature of any game.\n",
            "[Doc 1083]: In football, good strong defense provides a good field position, which allows the offense to start their drive-to-goal in a better position, thus allowing an easier time scoring. Additionally, good defense forces turnovers on the opponents, and turnovers’ impact on football scores cannot be overestimated. A positive turnover differential significantly increases the probability of winning. Moreover, in today’s professional football, interceptions are much more likely to be returned for touchdowns, as was seen in 2022 , when an interception by the Cincinnati Bengals’ led to their game-tying touchdown and eventual 2022 AFC championship win over Kansas City. Thus, defense is the best offense.\n",
            "[Doc 1141]: An old cliché says that defense wins championships in footbal l, mostly because a first-class defense is almost impossible to beat during playoff s. If so, and if the strongest football team ever should be determined by the quality of defense, it has to be the 1985 Chicago Bears. The 1985 Chicago Bears were notorious for their impenetrable revolutionary defense, which played together from 1984 to 1986. They went 15-1 in the 1985 season, and won that year’s Super Bowl while setting an NFL record for 72 sacks, allowing only 10 points during the playoffs. The next year, they set a then-NFL record (for a 16-game season), allowing only 186 points and losing in the playoffs only to the upcoming champions, the Washington Redskins.\n",
            "[Doc 34]: Contrary to what might be believed, a deep look into statistics proves defense can’t be relied on to win NFL championships, at least not more than offense does. In 2012, a behavioral economist teamed up with a Sports Illustrated journalist to write “ Scorecasting : The Hidden Influences behind How Sports Are Played and Games Are Won,” in which they analyzed data from 45 Super Bowls. A worn claim by the defense advocates is that the top-ranked defense during the regular NFL football season won 15 Super Bowls, whereas the top-ranked offense won only eight. The authors’ deeper look into statistics contradicts this claim. They assert that 38 out of 45 Super Bowls have been won by a top 10 defense and 22 have been won by a top 3 defense. Meanwhile, 38 Super Bowls have been won by a top 10 offense and 20 were won by a top 3 offense. So, if you widen the sample size, the differences are marginal, if they even exist.\n",
            "[Doc 12]: Getting to the Super Bowl means you have to be a consistent performer. A team needs to win three or four playoff matches in a row against the best teams in the league to qualify for the NFC and AFC championship games, let alone reach the Super Bowl (and then win it). That`s difficult to do, to say the least. During playoff games, this is when defense wins. Defense is about hard work, and it allows players to be competitive during games when nothing else works for their team. As the Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones showed in the 2023 AFC championship game, a good defensive play can end the other team’s offensive run before it even begins. The team’s defense again played a key role in their 2nd consecutive Super Bowl victory. Defense has historically given players the consistency they need to win their respective league championship games.\n",
            "[Doc 2430]: Some people think that if an activity does not involve defense or an opponent trying to affect your performance, then it is not a sport. In hockey, a player can steal the puck and a goalie can block a shot. In football, a pass can be intercepted and someone can be tackled to prevent him from scoring. There is no defense in golf, and participants are unable to impact the outcome of their opponents' scores.\n",
            "[Doc 3498]: Gary Lineker claims 'the world of football' wants GLT. He means by that, himself (who has a job making millions talking about football and can then claim to be a big champion of changes as he beats the GLT drum) and all those rich managers and footballers who can't take losing and will look for any scapegoat for their loss (it wasn't them being overpaid, overrated and not having the committment, skill, tactics etc but rather because the technology is not there!) He doesn't mean by 'the world of football' the ACTUAL WORLD OF FOOTBALL.....i.e. the thousands of football clubs all over the world plus the millions of players and supporters. However, the media is busy at the moment pumping a very one sided argument (as well as it being an irrational one) in favour of GLT, so the TV watching sheep will most likely repeat what they hear. No doubt FIFA and manufacturers will get very rich on the introduction of any such technology....endorsements etc. But all of this contradicts the idea of the South Africa 2010 world cup...opening football to the poor etc. In reality football would became a nintendo game on the pitch for the elite-rich.....with the rest of the world playing a game with very different equipment and different rules and standards.\n",
            "[Doc 2997]: The enjoyment of football is not just about the sport itself; we love the politics behind the scenes of football. In another sport, the transfers and team signings do not make big news. In football however, the transfer windows are big media hype. We want to know which club has got which players. We like to assess why managers would pick certain players over others. Most of all, we love to pass judgment on the referees decisions and his political motives behind them. Did he have an ulterior motive? Or should we complain that he is too far sighted to be a referee. Either way, we love delving into the politics. Politics isn’t perfect and neither is football. But if we marginalized the referees role, we would marginalize the political element in football, and this would make the game less analytical.\n",

Introducing GLT would be to completely change the nature of football for the least significant occurrence. These incidents tend to balance out over the season.

However, the level of strength needed to play football is the most important, and certainly greater than any other athletic ability needed to play basketball. Football players present an unprecedented power, strength and explosiveness. They deal with 250-300-pound titans ( most of whom can bench press over 500 lbs .) in an aggressive game that involves much more physical contact and collisions than basketball. While football players are not as quick as basketball players, they`re much stronger , which puts them on another level of athleticism.\n",

By focusing on breaking up the opposition’s plays, his teams punished them with counterattacks. Auerbach emphasized teamwork, drilling his players to form a cohesive unit that dominated other teams all over the court. He also invented the sixth man, which is a tactic that entails having one of the stronger non-starting players come off the bench to make a bigger impact when the game is already in full-swing.\n",

            "[Doc 1365]: No-one is forced to put advertising on their property - for many companies it is an important part of their income. Football teams would have much less money if they were not sponsored. Manchester United's shirt sponsorship deal with Aon is worth £80 million. For the small annoyance of having to have a logo on the shirt, the football club can afford to buy new players and hopefully win more games. And no-one is forced to look at advertising - you can turn the TV off between shows, or just flick past adverts in newspapers. If you don't want to see the adverts, then just ignore them.\n",
            "[Doc 1043]: The NFL is always evolving. During the past decade, there has been a shift in the league that favors the offense . Rules have changed that mostly favor offense . For example, with the Concussion Protocol, the ban on hitting a quarterback helmet-to-helmet, and on the “horse-collar tackle,” offense numbers are high. This trend is reflected in recent NFL seasons, which have been dominated by quarterbacks and passing offenses. The ball flies more , and apart from Super Bowl 50, recent seasons were dominated by offenses and specifically by Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes . Defense might have won football championships decades ago, but it doesn’t anymore.\n",
            "[Doc 1544]: Our commitment to transparency means surrendering part of our autonomy for the collective.

I do not have a right to know everything about the local football club (if I don’t play football and they are not a public company their decisions don’t affect me). Think tanks, however, are highly influential, and directly affect the society in which we live: some have, for example, lobbied successfully against action to prevent global warming.\n",
            "[Doc 2995]: The reason why football is so popular is because it is entertaining. If we were to be honest, we love the rule that referee's decision is final. We love to hate the referee. We enjoy the feeling of luck when it goes our way, and we love to moan when it does not go our way. So, whether we win or lose the game, we are entertained. To put video replays in football would deny us of this pleasure, and it would be to the detriment of the entertainment value of watching football. We may not feel good about our loss but we are moved by it, thus entertained. And there is enjoyment in mourning and yelling over a united cause. It gives people a reason to get together,rant,drink and have a good time. Targeting the referee, doodling a funny mustache on his photographs; sticking his face on a punching bag ... that sort of thing, proves to be very (immature) enjoyable. Who do you cuss when goal line technology boots your team? All the anger over any such unchallengeable loss would be pent up without relief and may cause serious problems later.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[118/185] Summarizing: Is Hall of Famer Derek Jeter the best shortstop of all time?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1224]: While Jeter may have made some flashy plays with the glove, defensive metrics overwhelmingly suggest that the Gold Gloves he was awarded were undeserved. Jeter’s defense cost the Yankees 246 runs defensively compared to the average player at his position, according to Baseball-reference.com, making him the worst of any player in history . And Bill James , a baseball statistician, called Jeter “the most ineffective defensive player in the major leagues, at any position.” While Jeter never made a ton of errors, he simply did not have the range of his fellow shortstops. Jeter was among the best in history with the bat – but in the field, he was at best below average .\n",
            "[Doc 51]: People who support inducting PED users into the Hall of Fame may argue that “we are not the morality police.” Supporters might also say, “we’re not talking about murderers and rapists, just the baseball Hall of Fame.” However, what about the morality argument? The Hall of Fame actually has a morality clause that refers to a player’s record, integrity, playing ability, character, sportsmanship, and contributions to his team as considerations for induction . Being recognized as top professionals in any field is an honor, which deserves respect. The Baseball Hall of Fame is a beautiful tradition that deserves to stay clean. This means leaving players who used PED out of it. After all, the players who used steroids chose not to play the game fairly. Nobody is asking to put them in jail, just not to give them baseball’s highest honor – as a Hall of Famer.\n",
            "[Doc 375]: While much of the praise of Jeter understandably focuses on his clutch hitting , leadership, and intangibles, it is important not to overlook his unparalleled hitting statistics. Jeter’s 3,465 hits are the most ever by a shortstop, and sixth most of any player at any position. He also leads all shortstops in runs ( Alex Rodriguez has him narrowly beat in this category but played less than half his games at the position), while his .310 career batting average is 35 points higher than Cal Ripken Jr. and Ernie Banks, two top contenders for the honor. Jeter is not known as a power hitter, and he certainly never threatened either of Barry Bonds’ home run records. But his 260 career home runs are more than all but two Hall of Fame shortstops (Banks and Ripken), and they blow away Honus Wagner’s 101. Though he never won an MVP award for a regular season, he finished in the top 10 in voting eight times (and in the top three spots thrice).\n",
            "[Doc 700]: Jeter was a great offensive player and was deservedly elected to the Hall of Fame . But there have been other shortstops who were better with the bat than the Yankees captain. For instance, Honus Wagner , who batted .328 and stole 723 bases over his career, was a more dominant force than Jeter ever was. Arky Vaughan , whose .318 average bests Jeter, would have comparable total had the prime of his career not been interrupted by World War II. Ernie Banks blasted 512 home runs, with his most productive years coming while playing the position. Jeter was very good hitter for a tremendously long career but was never a dominant force offensively. He never won a batting title, never hit 25 home runs, only drove in 100 runs once, and is not among the 15 shortstops who have won the MVP award.\n",
            "[Doc 1060]: In his first 10 season in the league, Alex Rodriguez blasted 345 home runs, collected more than 1,500 hits, won two gold gloves, and finished in the top 3 in MVP voting four times, winning the award in 2003. Had A-Rod stayed at the position, there would be no conversation about who was the greatest shortstop in baseball history. But in 2004, Rodriguez was traded to the New York Yankees and moved over to third base to allow Jeter to stay at his position. Even so, A-Rod played more career games at short than he did at the hot corner. When stacking Jeter up against the all-time greats, Rodriguez must be in the conversation, and with 696 career home runs and three MVP awards, he is on a different level than his longtime teammate.\n",
            "[Doc 1129]: Phil Jackson is the best of all time because he won an unequalled 11 NBA rings, six with the Chicago Bulls and three with the LA Lakers. He bested some tough opposition to achieve this, especially when compared to Auerbach, who played when the league was smaller and less competitive. Jackson has the highest winning percentage of any hall-of-famer or coach that oversaw 500 or more games. He won three ‘three-peats,’ meaning winning three championships in a row, even getting close to achieving a fourth one during his last season with the Lakers. Between 1991 and 2011, he went to a conference final 14 out of 20 times.\n",
            "[Doc 509]: If you ever visit the National Baseball Hall of Fame to learn about the game’s greatest players, you’ll find a number of players featured there who used steroids . Take legends Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. The Hall of Fame honors baseball’s best players, PED use or not. Therefore, you’ll learn about everyone before, during and after the “ Steroids Era ,” because it`s all part of Major League Baseball`s history, which is the point of the museum, after all.\n",
            "[Doc 179]: Most of the criticism surrounding Jeter centers around the claim that he was a liability on defense. That would be news to those who watched him play , as he was awarded five Gold Gloves, given to the best fielder at each position in the league. Jeter was unparalleled in his ability to make plays to his backhand side, jump, and throw a strike towards first. His 2004 catch as he dove into the crowd in a July game against the Red Sox showcased both his ability to track fly balls and his toughness. And “ The Flip ” in 2001 highlighted his uncanny defensive field awareness .\n",
            "[Doc 742]: The NFL draft is about making choices, which is always a question of alternatives. When picking Russell, the Raiders could have chosen Calvin Johnson, who was a great option and was considered as one of the most dynamic receivers in the league for a decade. Potential future Hall of Famers Joe Thomas (who is in the College Football Hall of Fame ), Adrian Peterson and Patrick Willis were alternative choices for Russell. The Chargers’ choice of Leaf is more understandable. During the 1998 draft, the Chargers needed a QB. They preferred Peyton Manning (who is considered one of the best QB of all times), but he was chosen first by the Colts. The Chargers were left with Leaf, who was then considered around the same level as Manning . So, the Raiders had better options and yet made the worst choice, which makes Russell a bigger bust.\n",
            "[Doc 209]: Like it or not, NBA basketball is a game of super stars. Players have a substantial impact on the game, their team, and even on their team`s squads and managerial decisions. Their egos are huge, and rightfully so, because during the money time, it`s them out there; they take the shots, and they take the blame for missed shots. Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever. Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton are Hall of Famers who were THE superstars of the golden era. Until today, they are considered as one of the best in their positions. The 1984 draft had the biggest star quality ever and should be considered the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 30]: Statistics, however, do not tell the whole story. Jeter had a record of rising to the occasion. His five World Series championships are a rarity in the Wild Card era – no one who has played since 1968 has won more. He was certainly on some great teams, but his performance – he batted a stellar .308 in the postseason over his career and was named World Series MVP in 2000 – certainly played a role. Longtime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner named him team captain in 2003, a title he held longer than any other Yankee. “I look at all the other leaders down through Yankee history, and Jeter is right there with them,” Steinbrenner noted. As Michael Jordan said, “He has qualities that separate superstars from everyday people.” Perhaps that’s why his nicknames include “Captain Clutch” and “Mr. November” – and why he is the only player in major league history to play at least 20 years without a single losing season, with a .593 career winning percentage.\n",
            "[Doc 653]: The mythical status of all professional athletes is long gone. Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods are just a couple examples of professional athletes who are no longer seen as being role models for youngsters. Today, we know much more about our sports heroes’ lives, for better and for worse. This insight has contributed to the erosion of their status as heroes. As athletes’ statuses change, our attitudes toward them do as well. This has led to a growing public understanding and acceptance of athletes who use PEDs. Thus, our criteria for including baseball players in the National Baseball Hall of Fame has softened over the years , allowing for the inclusion of PED users. In fact, some voters don’t feel that they should be passing judgement on players who used PEDs when there are reportedly racists, gamblers and wife beaters in the Hall of Fame.\n",
            "[Doc 1120]: It may be understandable that many players were under a lot of pressure and therefore felt they had to take PEDs to keep their stats high and take care of their families. However, also saying “I’m supposed to be in the Hall of Fame” despite knowingly cheating is wrong and distasteful.\n",
            "[Doc 443]: Russell`s work ethic and weight were the main reasons for his failure during his NFL years. These problems were known prior to his selection in the 2007 draft. Scout reports indicated a potential weight problem that could affect his quickness and agility, as well as his supposed poor work ethic . On the other hand, Leaf was supposed to be the next-big-thing in the NFL , and was one of the most coveted players in the1998 draft. Most scouts identified a vast amount of talent in him , and he was considered as being at the same level as Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. Eventually, it was a combination of injuries, immaturity , and lack of passion that paved Leaf’s way out of the league. Leaf was a typical example of a quarterback who had everything a coach would want in a quarterback . So, in comparison to Russell, whose problems were well known, Leaf`s failure was more surprising and disappointing.\n",
            "[Doc 927]: When Kobe played, he had a better supportive team around him, both on the court and in the coach position. Three out of Kobe`s five rings were won together with Shaquille O’Neil , possibly the best center to ever play the game. Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, although none of them is a hall-of-famer, make a fantastic supportive team. Moreover, Kobe won his five rings with former coach Phil Jackson , who many argue is probably the sharpest basketball mind to ever exist. Meanwhile, LeBron won his first two rings as part of the Miami Heat`s trio. Aside from Dwayne Wade, LeBron’s supportive team lacked the quality that Kobe`s support had. LeBron won his championship third ring against a team that scored the best regular season record ever. LeBron won the finals’ MVP award and was the most dominant player in every championship he won. He might have fewer championship rings than Kobe had, but he played a bigger part in achieving them.\n",
            "[Doc 2793]: In the world of work, in the world of relationships, in the world of family life, relaxation, further academic study, in all these worlds, one requires the ability not just to learn facts and hold understanding of certain intellectual systems in your head, but to make decisions, come up with ideas about how you want to proceed in using any of these things. You need a much more interactive relationship with the world than a simple 'it exists and I know certain things about it'. Perhaps this aspect of growing up is best provided elsewhere, such as the playground, where certain survival instincts and behavioural tactics are learned or beaten into you, but it seems incredible to me that the educational system couldn't go some way towards alleviating the disparity between how we are examined in the exam hall and how we come to use what we have learned in wider life.\n",
            "[Doc 2300]: Homework is a vital and valuable part of education. There are only a few hours in each school day – not enough time to cover properly all the subjects children need to study. Setting homework extends study beyond school hours, allowing a wider and deeper education. It also makes the best use of teachers, who can spend lesson time teaching rather than just supervising individual work that could be done at home. Education is about pushing boundaries, and the learning should not stop at the entrance to the classroom – students should take skills learnt in the classroom and apply them at home. Homework allows this to happen, encouraging students to go above and beyond what they do in school. Reading is the best example, students learn how to read at school, but in order to get better, they need to practise and that is best done at home, with the support of parents and at the right pace for the student.\n",
            "[Doc 290]: Football is a quarterback’s game, and the 1989 San Francisco 49ers had Joe Montana , probably the game`s most legendary quarterback. The 1991 Redskins had Mark Rypien who, with all due respect, was not on the same level as Montana. Additionally, the 1989 San Francisco 49ers were one of the few teams to win two consecutive championships, with an impressive 55-10 win against a Denver Broncos (which was quarterbacked by a future Hall-of-Famer) in Super Bowl 1989. And there is more: Much like the 1991 Redskins, the 1989 San Francisco 49ers lost only two games by a total of five points. Their offense, led by Montana and the legendary wide receiver Jerry Rice , was exhilarating, finishing first in the NFL in scoring (27.6 points per game).\n",
            "[Doc 1289]: Baseball, like all sports, “is the pursuit of transcending imperfection.”   It is not supposed to be executed with robotic perfection; it is supposed to involve human beings all trying their best to do the best they can. Fallible umpire calls are part of the drama of baseball. Many people enjoy the excitement that comes with the fallibility of umpire's calls. This sub-plot in baseball in unique and should be preserved. Indeed, fooling the ump is a time-honored part of the game. It is a colourful, even skilful way to work within the imperfect, very human parameters that the sport.\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",

            "[119/185] Summarizing: Can Soccer be the next big American sport?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 121]: Soccer has been America’s favorite sport among children for years now. The suburban “soccer-mom” who drives her kids to practice in an SUV has become a staple in American life. In fact, more American teenagers are playing soccer than ever before, with the number of US high schoolers playing the game reaching over 850K girls and boys . This large pool of young talent promises further growth and potential success at the adult level. Plus, a Gallup poll shows that because of Millennials’ love of the sport, soccer’s popularity has tripled in the last decade and currently ranks fourth among all sports. In fact, regarding watching soccer , no other sport has seen such a jump in fanbase over the years, according to the Washington Post.\n",
            "[Doc 525]: Already seen as a kid’s sport in most of the country, soccer’s reputation among Americans has been tarnished by the many examples of diving , the act of feigning or exaggerating injury to have an opposing player disqualified. Particularly to fans of a more hands-on sport like American football, the diving and acting sometimes seen in soccer paint a dishonest and underhanded image of the sport. Many Americans have difficulty getting behind a sport that, to them, encourages cheating.\n",
            "[Doc 797]: The US women’s national soccer team and its winning streak have produced inspiring players both on and off the field, some of whom, like team captain Megan Rapinoe , among other iconic players , are amassing global fans, young and old, which cultivates attention to the sport, especially for young female players. Women’s soccer aside, after Beckham, stars such as Ricardo Kaká, Thierry Henry, Steven Gerrard and now Lionel Messi have crossed the Atlantic. Such arrivals, coupled with significant investment in new stadiums, have increased the number of Americans attending games. With the establishment of new clubs in LA, Atlanta, Minnesota and Miami, among others, and further investment in big-name players and modern stadiums, soccer’s emergence as one of America’s top sports may still happen, especially with 16 American cities set to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n",
            "[Doc 1044]: The United States has a rapidly growing Latino population, of which there were 65.3 million in the country as of 2020. Between 2008-2018, 12.6% of the men’s national team were players of Latino origins. While the 2022 men’s national team that played in Qatar reportedly only had 3 Latino players , it’s hard to ignore this small but potentially growing influence that immigrants have on US soccer. Immigrants specifically from Mexico or Brazil tend to bring along their love for the sport, spreading it to their kids. If more of these future American players will be allowed to play professional soccer, the quality of the national team could increase and games will get more followers. Improving both factors may contribute to the sport’s growth in the US.\n",
            "[Doc 1533]: The male world-view which dominates sports media and conveys to the public that women’s sport are inferior to men’s reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and deter young girls from becoming active in sport. Gender perceptions have obviously come a long way in the last 100 years, but the media classification of women’s sport as inferior to men’s is severely slowing this progress in the field of sport. Humans are social beings with esteem needs, and as social beings we like to be viewed in a positive light by our peers. This is best achieved on a general level by conforming to social expectations and norm. This also applies for societal conceptions of gender. The fact that the media deems women’s sport to be of lesser importance which (as we have seen) conveys to the public this message, reinforces the notion that sport is not a worthwhile activity for women and girls. Instead, it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys. This kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves. In this way, the lack of media coverage of women’s sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one’s ability; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do. This is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women. As more women take part in sport, this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which, in turn, induces further women to become engaged in sport. This is a desirable outcome from the government’s perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active. Those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like Coronary Heart Disease and cancer, but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising, and the joy of feeling physically fit.\n",
            "[Doc 41]: First-class NFL defenses , with an elite coach, are nearly impossible to beat. No matter the sport, defensive plays can create a huge psychological impact on the opponent`s offense; they put great pressure on opponents and can frustrate them. A brilliant defensive strategy can change the course of the game, whether football, basketball or soccer. In fact, the importance of a great defense in football is much like its importance in basketball, or the importance of the goalie in hockey and in soccer. A team just can’t win games or championships without defense; it`s part of the nature of any game.\n",
            "[Doc 234]: Due process, or the right to a fair trial for the accused, is a cornerstone of the US Constitution and the bedrock of the American justice system. Any accused person on American territory, whether they are American or not , is protected by these laws. While drone strikes are conducted far away, location hardly negates the American imperative that all men are innocent until proven guilty. (The CIA counts any military-aged men in a strike zone as combatants). The American public would be outraged were any other government to kill an American on the mere presumption that he is a terrorist, without offering any proof. America should apply its own standards for justice abroad as it does at home, even if it’s impractical.\n",
            "[Doc 38]: Watching Arsenal play during their heyday, one would realize they were the best and most attractive soccer team to ever play in Premier League. Arsenal not only rode the longest undefeated run in Premier League history (49 games, including an entire season without a loss), but did so in a stylish, eye-captivating way, with exciting soccer that is based on technique and short passing. Wenger pioneered Arsenal’s purist game philosophy. It still shapes the present team’s style of play. This adventurous gameplay should be appreciated, especially by those who love the beauty of soccer. Even when he is long gone, this way of playing will remain deeply embedded within the club.\n",
            "[Doc 295]: This show has a story that’s big on emotions . Though it has its share of funny moments too, Moulin Rouge is, at heart, a tragic play. From the first moment to the inevitable end, the story contains big aspects: there’s big drama, big love, and big jealousy. The love at the center of the story is a sacred entity, the show’s villain is as evil as they come, and the friendship is as brave as they come – it’s opera-size in its vividness and is also unapologetic, which fits with the over-the-top world of the show. If you are into a roller coaster of emotions, get a ticket to this show!\n",
            "[Doc 1135]: Big Data is too large for the average person to analyze on his or her own. Therefore, most people and many companies lack the data analysis required for informed decision-making that may provide competitive advantage. Such analysis requires advanced technological tools that many people simply don’t have. Therefore, it’s not a level playing field , as the large, wealthy institutions may be able to benefit more from big data compared to small businesses or individual people. Aside from the unfair economic disadvantage, Big Data fosters divisive lines between social classes. At least 7% of Americans aren’t online, and people from lower income levels don’t leave nearly as big a digital footprint as their wealthier counterparts. This means that when researchers or journalists rely on web-generated content (like social media or Google searches) for Big Data analyses, those without an online presence tend to have their own issues ignored. In other words, Big Data only benefits the people who are rich enough to control it.\n",
            "[Doc 1041]: Most of the voices calling for Wenger’s resignation came from Arsenal fans. There’s nothing new in soccer fans calling for the dismissal of a club coach; it’s part of the game’s nature. It happens often because soccer fans always want more from the team they support. However, the demand to see Wenger leave was based on emotions rather than on realistic thinking . Arsenal’s rivals, like Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City, are far richer, and their regularly finishing in the top spots of British soccer is extraordinary. Arsenal fans got used to Wenger leading his team into the top league rankings in the past, so, once the team started losing, they found it hard to acknowledge the fantastic work done by the Frenchman. The way that fans called for him to leave was wrong and ignored his contributions to the club.\n",
            "[Doc 1770]: Shooting is sport enjoyed by many law-abiding people, both in gun clubs with purpose-built ranges and as a field sport. These people have the right to continue with their chosen leisure pursuit, on which they have spent large amounts of money – an investment the government would effectively be confiscating if their guns were confiscated.\n",
            "[Doc 1283]: The show and the celebration of human physical achievement is what makes sport enjoyable to the public. The reason people enjoy sport is because it is a demonstration of what other fellow human beings can achieve and what humans can achieve collectively, as a species. A spectacle is designed to amaze. It doesn’t need to be human achievement to be amazing (no one would call monster truck driving a sport). So, when humans start taking drugs to improve performance, it is no longer a sport, it is a spectacle, because there is no human physical achievement, but instead a chemical achievement. It also becomes a celebration not of human physical achievement, but of human intellectual achievement, of who can design the best drugs. Even with fancy running shoes, we are still celebrating human achievement, which will not happen once you take it to the extreme of allowing drug use. This doesn’t benefit athletes in the long run. Athletes won’t be celebrated but scientists will!\n",
            "[Doc 564]: Boxing is the most athletic sport around. In fact, boxing is used in training for NFL players to enhance their hand-eye coordination and agility. A few years ago, a wide panel of sports experts, including sports scientists, researchers, athletes and journalists, objectively ranked the level of athleticism needed to compete in 60 sports. To determine the level of athleticism needed, each sport was broken down into 10 categories: endurance, strength, power, speed, agility, flexibility, nerve, durability, hand-eye coordination and analytic aptitude. Then, the experts ranked each category for each sport. The average represents the difficulty level of each sport. According to the most scientific comparative research made in that subject, boxers are the best athletes, not basketball players.\n",
            "[Doc 1388]: Baseball is not a contact sport. It is not a sport that is supposed to rely on violence. This is one commentator’s point: “if you want to watch violent collisions, you can watch football. There’s no reason baseball needs to have similar kinds of plays; it’s an entirely different sport with a different premise and different rules.” Baseball tries to make the game safe for its players. That’s why beanballs—pitches that endanger hitters—are disallowed. Baseball should not promote violence, and it certainly shouldn’t allow it when players’ careers hang in the balance.\n",
            "[Doc 2997]: The enjoyment of football is not just about the sport itself; we love the politics behind the scenes of football. In another sport, the transfers and team signings do not make big news. In football however, the transfer windows are big media hype. We want to know which club has got which players. We like to assess why managers would pick certain players over others. Most of all, we love to pass judgment on the referees decisions and his political motives behind them. Did he have an ulterior motive? Or should we complain that he is too far sighted to be a referee. Either way, we love delving into the politics. Politics isn’t perfect and neither is football. But if we marginalized the referees role, we would marginalize the political element in football, and this would make the game less analytical.\n",
            "[Doc 1532]: Sport is dominated by a male-orientated world view. This is the case in two respects: This male dominated world-view is unfair on female athletes. Sport is supposed to be a celebration of the human mind and body, and it is right that athletes that push themselves to the brink in search for glory receive due praise. The hugely skewed coverage of sport against women’s sports caused by the male world-view in the media is hugely unfair on female athletes, as they do not get the deserved recognition their male counterparts receive.\n",
            "[Doc 473]: Virtual reality is considered by many to be the future of gaming. Putting the gamer inside his game is the next big thing. Just image yourself out there playing sports with your favorite all-stars, racing in your favorite car, or being in the middle of a battlefield. With Sony’s VR gaining some heat , Xbox doesn’t look like it will be joining the race anytime soon. This gives Sony a big step in the right direction into the future of gaming . With this cool new feature being available to everyone now, we just hope you don’t end up like this guy:\n",
            "[Doc 3936]: Big businesses would like to keep track of you all the time. If they could, they would want to know when you get up, go to sleep, and eat. However, privacy online makes this hard for them to achieve it. You can change your setting so that you are not being used as a commodity by big businesses.\n",
            "[Doc 718]: Sports like basketball and football are deeply intertwined with American culture. It has become a family ritual to watch the baseball World Series in the fall and football on Thanksgiving. The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting and arguably cultural event in the country. Playing fantasy football and following college basketball March Madness unites college fans, families and colleagues all over the country. To many, basketball is a great unifier: it’s seen as an integral part of inner-city culture just as much as it is of suburban America. Through their presence in US history, these sports have become synonymous with being American. Soccer may never evoke such feelings of history, identity and pride.\n",

The primary reason for soccer’s unpopular status in the United States is the American culture .

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[120/185] Summarizing: NASCAR or Formula 1 – Which is the prime racing competition?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1208]: NASCAR is a nail-biting battle with constant bumper-to-bumper action. Every driver has a good chance of winning, rather than following what often seems to be a pre-determined hierarchy in Formula 1. Without a major technological advantage, NASCAR drivers’ talent is on full display. No one simply wins because their machine is faster. NASCAR drivers never stop duelling each other for every inch, with a takeover possible at any moment. In fact, in Formula 1, overtaking is frustratingly rare because the cars’ aerodynamics make doing so incredibly difficult. Whereas vehicles like those in NASCAR create a slipstream that gives those behind them a slight speed advantage, Formula 1 cars are designed to prevent this. Often one of them holds pole position for the whole duration of the race, making the outcome more predictable and therefore less exciting.\n",
            "[Doc 1059]: People who like cars like the machines, first and foremost. Formula 1 features the boldest racing engines on the planet. It’s a car nerd’s dream. Cars are worth between $12-$15 million (compared to $300,000 in NASCAR). Formula 1 cars use turbochargers and superchargers and reach significantly higher speeds (their average top speed is around 220 mph versus 200 mph in NASCAR). Every team is given the freedom to innovate to beat the competition. For example, in 2011, Red Bull created a car with an exhaust-blown diffuser that gave it a significant advantage. Other teams quickly reacted by copying the design. Formula 1’s governing body then banned this tech, but that just resulted in engineers creating workarounds to still gain the priceless advantage.\n",
            "[Doc 77]: One of the things that makes Formula 1 so special is the international locations and drivers that it features. Every race feels like a racing world cup, with dozens of countries featured. The very best race car drivers Holland has to offer and the top engineers from Germany join Formula 1. Virtually every country’s best drivers and racing engineers are competing to join it. NASCAR just doesn’t have this international pull. Formula 1 also proved its appeal when the Netflix show Drive to Survive became a global hit. Its five seasons have given viewers a profound look behind the scenes, at the rivalries and the politics of the sport. In so doing, the show has created millions of new global fans.\n",
            "[Doc 1070]: The 2022 nationwide shortage of infant formula is a prime example of why breastmilk is the better choice: It’s available more or less on-demand. Industry is plagued by human error, and the powdered formula industry is no exception. The CDC reports 4-6 cases of infant Cronobacter (a bacteria associated with meningitis) infection each year, which stems from contaminated formula. Beyond contamination, formula makers do not always ensure consumer safety. One extreme case of the failure of powdered formula to properly nourish infants comes from Israel, where, in 2003, vitamin B-1 deficient Remedia formula led to 3 infant deaths and severe damage to 23 other infants. These risk factors, though slight, are valid reasons to encourage breastfeeding in hospitals and in general.\n",
            "[Doc 891]: NASCAR has always been a sport with a huge following, partly due to its accessibility. During a NASCAR race, fans have the unique ability to tune in to their favorite team’s live communications with a radio scanner and follow the action going on behind the scenes. When you buy your ticket, you’re allowed to visit the teams’ pits and trailers. Ask for an autograph or a selfie, watch the engineers do their magic. This kind of access simply isn’t possible in Formula 1, where drivers are completely inaccessible to fans. Instead, Formula 1 features VIP sections where spectators drink champagne while networking with each other.\n",
            "[Doc 690]: NASCAR takes place on a short, circular racetrack, which allows the audience to follow the whole race at all stages. The entire track is visible to spectators at any time, allowing them to follow all key moments with their own eyes. This creates an immersive and engaging experience for the audience. They can pick and choose whether to follow the duels at the front or focus on who is fighting for 10th spot. In Formula 1, tracks are so long that audience members only ever see a small section of them. The race cars usually thunder by in mere seconds, making it harder to understand what’s going on.\n",
            "[Doc 3026]: If a celebrity wanted to become Prime Minister surely they would have to have went to university and studied politics! it is not fair that people who have worked hard to become an MP ;who then try to go onto becoming Prime Minister and only to be beaten to it by a celebrity who has walked in and decided s/he wants to become the leader of their country! The Prime Minister also has to make important decisions although there are always a minority who don't agree with these decisions, it is better for someone who has studied politics to make these decisions that will effect peoples life rather than a singer, dancer or a tv presenter! could you really imagine Cheryl Cole being our Prime Minister- no offense inflicted on Cheryl Cole but she is not a politician she is a singer. but if a celebrity has gone and studied politics and graduated from university i would be very happy for her to be our Prime Minister\n",
            "[Doc 1173]: If you were born in America between 1950 and 1980, chances are you received plenty of formula and are none the worse for it. While the prevailing rhetoric of today’s breastfeeding camp would have you believe that bottle-fed children are disadvantaged, the fact is that millions of healthy humans have been raised on formula. In fact, in 2018, the US shot down a pro-breastfeeding resolution proposed by the World Health Assembly; the US argued that women should not be stigmatized for finding alternative ways to feed their babies if need be. It’s important to remember that just as today’s seeming preference for breastfeeding is rooted in culture as well as science, so was the mid-twentieth century’s preference for bottle-feeding. Bottle-feeding was a symbol of scientific parenting and modernity, and parents were eager to embrace it. As formula is becoming even more scientifically advanced, there is no real reason to prefer one method over the other.\n",
            "[Doc 2993]: Learning, for example, the quadratic formula, is only useful for those who are mathematically brained and those who wish to have a career in higher mathematics, science, engineering.\n",
            "[Doc 1547]: Even think tanks benefit from the introduction of this policy. The status quo leaves disclosure as a strategic device: think tanks are unwilling to disclose more than their competition for fear of being unfavourably portrayed. Such negative competition, i.e. competition in factors that do not improve the products of the market, makes them unable to make rational decisions about their funding if, for instance, potential funders want to contribute only on the condition that this funding be made public. As a consequence, the advent of organisations who call for transparency has been praised by prominent think tanks like the New Economics Foundation.\n",
            "[Doc 1344]: What is the difference between gambling and playing the stock market? In each case people are putting money at risk in the hope of a particular outcome. Gambling on horse-racing or games involves knowledge and expertise that can improve your chances of success. In the same way, trading in bonds, shares, currency or derivatives is a bet that your understanding of the economy is better than that of other investors. Why should one kind of online risk-taking be legal and the other not?\n",
            "[Doc 1573]: What is the difference between gambling and playing the stock market? In each case people are putting money at risk in the hope of a particular outcome. Gambling on horse-racing or games involves knowledge and expertise that can improve your chances of success. In the same way, trading in bonds, shares, currency or derivatives is a bet that your understanding of the economy is better than that of other investors. Why should one kind of online risk-taking be legal and the other not?\n",
            "[Doc 3429]: Again as asserted in the debate definition; free market efficiency is an ideal that can only be achieved as a result of unconstrained naked competition. Prices will only land to where they should be in equilibrium where price demands by both consumers and producers/sellers meet if competition impinges everything else out of the way.\n",
            "[Doc 3430]: On the whole competition ensures that students display the best of their abilities using whatever resources they can. Whether these resources are unfairly distributed or are inherently diabolical is irrelevant because the object of competition is to reveal what students students can do in the exam room that is conditioned the same way for all students taking the examination. If the examination occurs now; the point of the examination is to determine where the student stands now and not how s/he got there. Examiners are interested in what the students know and share within the examination room and at the time of the examination. Competition forces those with a comparable paucity in resources to work harder than their better-equipped contemporaries. And there have been considerable cases in which those from broken homes performed better than those from aristocratic ones.\n",
            "[Doc 254]: Adding another player to the market creates competition between firms. This is positive, as competition is good for business and consumers. Buyers will get better prices for products (not to mention better quality of products) while companies will be able to learn from each other to perfect their respective product(s) and focus on what they do best. True, by being a fast follower, you will have to always bring your “A game”; this is the only way to succeed. However, this will also result in higher customer satisfaction, which may lead to larger revenues down the line.\n",
            "[Doc 3428]: As asserted in the definition of this debate competition creates merit. Survival of the fittest; means that the fittest come out on top. The end-result of aggressive competition is weeding out those who are no good and seeding out those who outshine their contemporaries/counterparts emerging victorious.\n",
            "[Doc 250]: What do Amazon, eBay and Coca-Cola have in common? These three companies had this motto in mind. They acted fast solely on the belief in their product. By being a first mover, you get a head start on your potential competition and are in a prime position to test the product with real users. This process, where testing and adapting are done in front of real users, as opposed to a development lab, is at the heart of the popular “lean startup” dogma.\n",
            "[Doc 516]: During searches, Amazon users get the added bonus of being presented with similar products or products frequently purchased together. This makes Amazon’s comparison-shopping of brand vs. brand or product vs. related product fast and effortless. Another benefit of shopping on Amazon is the immediacy in which purchases are received. With services like Amazon Prime, the customer journey of “search – select – pay – possess” is near-instantaneous. Since Amazon delivers nearly two-thirds of its own orders directly to consumers, it’s no wonder that the company is giving UPS and FedEx a run for their money, competition that will only benefit consumers. It’s much faster than most other e-commerce stores. This benefit was appreciated during the pandemic lockdowns, as with efforts to combat price gouging. Being the market leader means that the standard Amazon adopts becomes the market standard, which, in turn, benefits all consumers. This can also be seen with Amazon’s PillPack acquisition , which highlights how its embrace of disruptive competition is a good thing for consumers.\n",
            "[Doc 1386]: Where there is international competition transparency can be a problem if there is not transparency on both sides as one side is essentially giving its opponent an advantage. This is ultimately why countries keep national security secrets; they are in competition with other nations and the best way to ensure an advantage over those states is to keep capabilities secret. One side having information while the other does not allows the actor that has the information to act differently in response to that knowledge. Keeping things secret can therefore provide an advantage when making a decision, as the one with most information is most likely to react best.\n",
            "[Doc 1206]: With Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods and its subsequent launch of Amazon Fresh in the spring of 2021, the company has become a monopoly of successfully merchandizing convenience, especially during the pandemic. Between Amazon Prime, as well as introducing cashierless supermarkets , the company will continue accounting for a large chunk of consumers’ spending. But shoppers may ultimately lose out; monopolies kill competition (e.g., Amazon was put under the spotlight for using data from its own sellers to launch competing products) and, once king, they can willingly change customer perks that made them so popular in the first place. Plus, the growing success of Amazon and its slew of digital endeavors may cause people and shop owners to lose their jobs as online purchases continue to climb. As Amazon expands to target other goods sectors, including providing delivery services for restaurant-prepared meals and Prime Air , its drone delivery service, which may put delivery people out of work.\n",
            "[Doc https://www.theperspective.com/debates/sports/nascar-or-formula-1-which-is-the-prime-racing-competition]: When it comes to professional car racing , NASCAR and Formula 1 are the two prime competitions . Formula 1 features the boldest racing engines on the planet. It’s a car nerd’s dream. Cars are worth between $12-$20 million (compared to $300,000 in NASCAR ).\n",
            "[Doc https://performancedriversclub.org/nascar-vs-formula1/]: 1. Nascar and Formula 1 are two different types of racing with distinct cars, tracks, and rules. 2. While Nascar cars may have higher top speeds, Formula 1 cars are more advanced in terms of technology and handling.\n",

            "[121/185] Summarizing: Throwback – Which is the best NBA draft EVER: 1984 or 1996?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 1225]: The 1984 draft included Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton. Hakeem won two championships, was twice named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, and once the finals MVP. Barkley and Stockton won the Western Conference and made it to the finals three times (combined), only to lose to Michael Jordan. The 1984 draft players reached the NBA finals five times in the 90`s, which is considered as the league`s golden era. This era was dominated by Jordan , but if it wasn’t for him, it is fair to say that his 1984-draft buddies would have dominated and would have won more championship rings. Take out Jordan, and the 1984 draft is still the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 344]: The NBA draft is about predicting each player’s ability. Teams make selections according to a player`s potential and talent. The best draft should be the one with the most talented – not the most successful – players. The 1996 draft had the most talented players, including Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant , two of the most talented NBA players ever, and other huge talents like Steve Nash and Stephon Marbury. The 1984 draft didn’t have the most talented players. Hakeem, Barkley and John Stockton were superstars with huge careers, but mostly due to their characters and determination, not necessarily due to their talent. If you look at drafts by the amount of talent, it`s the 1996 that claims the top spot.\n",
            "[Doc 209]: Like it or not, NBA basketball is a game of super stars. Players have a substantial impact on the game, their team, and even on their team`s squads and managerial decisions. Their egos are huge, and rightfully so, because during the money time, it`s them out there; they take the shots, and they take the blame for missed shots. Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever. Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton are Hall of Famers who were THE superstars of the golden era. Until today, they are considered as one of the best in their positions. The 1984 draft had the biggest star quality ever and should be considered the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 83]: In sports, greatness is usually measured by titles and championship rings. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of our time because he won six rings ; the NFL’s Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever because he surpassed Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw by winning his seventh Super Bowl ring, and John Federer is the best tennis player ever because he has won 20 Grand Slams. Accordingly, the 1984 draft is not the best ever. Jordan, Olajuwon, Barkley, Thorpe and Stockton have nine rings combined. In contrast, the 1996 draft players – Bryant, Allen, Walker, Stojakovic, Fisher (who was picked in the 24th spot and played a key role in few LA Lakers championships) and Ben Wallace (not drafted) – have a total of fifteen rings.\n",
            "[Doc 303]: They say you`re as good as your weakest link. The 1984 draft had no weak links. Who could be considered the weakest link there exactly? John Stockton , the league leader in assists and steals to this day? Or Sir Charles (Barkley ), who was one of the greatest rebounders of his time? The 1996 draft had far more weaker links, especially compared to Barkley or Stockton. Steve Nash was considered as a lesser version of Stockton, and a far worse defensive player. Allen Iverson is considered one of the most talented players ever, but he never fulfilled his potential. Kobe Bryant was a phenomenon, but if you consider players like Markus Camby, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, or Stephon Marbury of the 1996 draft, this one had weaker links.\n",
            "[Doc 11]: Auerbach had a special eye for discovering rising stars and building a winning team out of them. He pushed hard for Bill Russell in the 1956 NBA draft, seeing huge potential in his defensive qualities. Russell became a key part in the team’s ability to stop opposition advances and then start their own counterattacks. Molding young players in the ways he saw fit, Auerbach offered a springboard to players like John Havlicek, who then became the engine behind many of the championships they won together. In 1978, it was Auerbach’s vision that drove the Celtics to draft Larry Bird, who was still relatively unknown. He turned out to be one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen. Auerbach’s negotiation skills were key here as they gave him an edge in getting the players he wanted.\n",
            "[Doc 56]: Larry Bird played with a group of players whose collective talent was no way near the talent level of Magic`s teammates. Magic played with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , arguably the best center to have ever played the game, and with James Worthy , a No. 1 draft pick, three-time NBA champion, and one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history. Bird, himself, is what made the Celtics great. With Bird, the Celtics shot from 29 wins to 60 wins in a regular season. His spirit and mentality positively affected the entire team. This is not to say that his teammates were bad players, but Robert Parish , Dennis Johnson and Cedric Maxwell , to mention a few, were not as talented as the Lakers’ players at that time. Bird had less to work with, and without him, the Celtics would probably be a mediocre team, which cannot be said about Magic.\n",
            "[Doc 742]: The NFL draft is about making choices, which is always a question of alternatives. When picking Russell, the Raiders could have chosen Calvin Johnson, who was a great option and was considered as one of the most dynamic receivers in the league for a decade. Potential future Hall of Famers Joe Thomas (who is in the College Football Hall of Fame ), Adrian Peterson and Patrick Willis were alternative choices for Russell. The Chargers’ choice of Leaf is more understandable. During the 1998 draft, the Chargers needed a QB. They preferred Peyton Manning (who is considered one of the best QB of all times), but he was chosen first by the Colts. The Chargers were left with Leaf, who was then considered around the same level as Manning . So, the Raiders had better options and yet made the worst choice, which makes Russell a bigger bust.\n",
            "[Doc 82]: Jordan is probably the biggest brand ambassador that basketball and the NBA have ever had. He was a mythical player, who moved and scored in ways that set him apart from everyone else. His fadeaway jump shot. His up-and-under finish. His ability to make it look easy to slip by the other team’s defense. Jordan’s unique technique allowed him to jump in the air and ‘hang’ there that many fractions of a second longer than others. He could pull off dazzling moves that excited fans everywhere and brought many new ones to the sport. It was his almost alien talent that set him apart, landing him a role in the 1996 Looney Tunes movie Space Jam (which earned more than James’ 2021 Space Jam sequel) and making him a global household name.\n",
            "[Doc 686]: Jordan is very likely to have been the most clutch player that has ever played the game. This means that he was able to raise his game when the pressure was the highest. His game winner , during his last Chicago Bulls game to secure the championship and his second three-peat with the team, stands out. Jordan won the NBA finals MVP award six times , compared to James’s four times. Sure James is now the NBA top scorer of all time, but Jordan was known as a king at scoring the game-winning shot in the final seconds of play. On the other hand, James still struggles to shed his reputation as a “ choker ,” for having fallen direly short in big moments. Jordan is better because he always delivered the good when it really mattered.\n",
            "[Doc 1140]: The NBA has changed in recent years. Today, the game favors speed and shooting. This change didn’t occur out of nowhere – it happened after a new era of players with greater physical and athletic abilities arrived in the league. NBA players now combine height together with shooting abilities and speed (which was considered rare only 15 years ago). Also, as basketball became faster, players needed to develop more endurance. Given that some players shoot from such a large distance away from the basket (like the late Kobe Bryant did, and today’s Stephen Curry still does) that some suggest moving the 3-point line back or even applying a 4-point line . This is an example of how basketball players’ athletic abilities have gotten significantly better, which can’t be said for athletes in any other sport.\n",
            "[Doc 2280]: Even if a voucher scheme is used, parents still need to have considerable input in order that their children are able to access the best educational opportunities. Thus, those children who are most vulnerable, i.e. those with inadequate home support structures, will find that they are unable to access the best schools as their parents may lack the desire or knowledge to find out which schools are the best in their area. Further, this problem will be exacerbated by the subsequent dearth of funding at the worst schools.\n",
            "[Doc 646]: The 2021 Hollywood Diversity report demonstrated clear gains in the number of lead movie roles played by people of color ( 43% ). The 2022 Oscars also confirm a brightened spotlight on minority actors. Will Smith nabbed Best Actor for his role in King Richard , a film about African-American sports legends Serena and Venus Williams. And Ariana DeBose was the first openly queer woman of color and second Latina to ever win Best Supporting Actress. Looking back, the surprise hit of 2018, the all-Asian film Crazy Rich Asians , also shows that audiences are embracing on-screen diversity. Another case in point, the 2020 Oscar winner for Best Picture, the first-ever non-English-speaking film Parasite. Even the small screen has been making strides in ethnic diversity in recent years, with major network shows like Fresh of the Boat , “blackish” (and its two spinoffs),One Day at a Time , Empire and the award-winning Atlanta , all of which almost exclusively feature minority casts . In 2018, Sandra Oh was the first actor of Asian descent to ever be nominated for lead actress in a TV drama, and she followed up in 2019 with the historic Golden Globe win.\n",
            "[Doc 506]: Beyond tactics, Auerbach transformed the NBA by accelerating its embrace of previously shunned black athletes. He drafted the first-ever black player, Chuck Cooper , in 1950. Fourteen years later, he sent out the first-ever all-black starting five. Auerbach was also the first to hire a black head coach in 1966, Bill Russell . He prioritized talent over skin color at a time when Jim Crow laws were still being applied in the US. Black players rewarded him with successes, playing a big part in the Boston Celtics’ eight-year championship run.\n",
            "[Doc 750]: Red Auerbach’s creative understanding of the game allowed him to revolutionize it tactically. His touch turned the flailing Boston Celtics into a real fighting force, the only team to ever win eight consecutive NBA championships. He valued defense over offense. By focusing on breaking up the opposition’s plays, his teams punished them with counterattacks. Auerbach emphasized teamwork, drilling his players to form a cohesive unit that dominated other teams all over the court. He also invented the sixth man, which is a tactic that entails having one of the stronger non-starting players come off the bench to make a bigger impact when the game is already in full-swing.\n",
            "[Doc 963]: Defense wins titles. Sure, you have to be a good offensive team, obviously, but in the nerve-racking finals , having a better defensive team has, historically, made winning the title more likely. In the Kobe vs. LeBron debate, both players were/are huge talents with enormous offensive abilities. While LeBron was named six times in the NBA All-Defensive team , Kobe was named 12 times in the NBA All-Defensive team. The latter’s defensive contribution was key in breaking up opponents’ movements and starting counterattacks. This diverse skill set gave him more of an ability to lift up his team in any stage of the game.\n",
            "[Doc 443]: Russell`s work ethic and weight were the main reasons for his failure during his NFL years. These problems were known prior to his selection in the 2007 draft. Scout reports indicated a potential weight problem that could affect his quickness and agility, as well as his supposed poor work ethic . On the other hand, Leaf was supposed to be the next-big-thing in the NFL , and was one of the most coveted players in the1998 draft. Most scouts identified a vast amount of talent in him , and he was considered as being at the same level as Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. Eventually, it was a combination of injuries, immaturity , and lack of passion that paved Leaf’s way out of the league. Leaf was a typical example of a quarterback who had everything a coach would want in a quarterback . So, in comparison to Russell, whose problems were well known, Leaf`s failure was more surprising and disappointing.\n",
            "[Doc 625]: Draft busts aren’t set solely by players’ failures to meet expectations but also by their field performance. The intensity of a player’s failure on the field is a decisive factor when evaluating bust levels. A look at the stats of Leaf and Russell proves that Leaf was a bigger failure on the field.\n",
            "[Doc 1141]: An old cliché says that defense wins championships in footbal l, mostly because a first-class defense is almost impossible to beat during playoff s. If so, and if the strongest football team ever should be determined by the quality of defense, it has to be the 1985 Chicago Bears. The 1985 Chicago Bears were notorious for their impenetrable revolutionary defense, which played together from 1984 to 1986. They went 15-1 in the 1985 season, and won that year’s Super Bowl while setting an NFL record for 72 sacks, allowing only 10 points during the playoffs. The next year, they set a then-NFL record (for a 16-game season), allowing only 186 points and losing in the playoffs only to the upcoming champions, the Washington Redskins.\n",
            "[Doc https://www.theperspective.com/debates/sports/throwback-best-nba-draft-ever-1984-1996]: 1984 draft is the best even without Jordan. The 1984 draft included Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and John Stockton.The 1984 draft players reached the NBA finals five times in the 90`s, which is considered as the league`s golden era.\n",

            "[122/185] Summarizing: The Perspective on Single-Payer Health Care\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 857]: Americans are paying more than other developed countries for their health care. Let’s look at Canada, France, Sweden and Switzerland, for example. These are all countries that have a similar GDP per capita to the US but offer single-payer health care systems. According to OECD data , these countries spent between 10 and 12 percent of their GDP on health care costs compared to a whopping 17 percent of the America’s GDP. There are several reasons for this. Cutting the massive administrative costs associated with private health care, for example, would reduce overall health care spending by around 15 percent, according to one study .\n",
            "[Doc 265]: Sure, it may be nice to envision single-payer health care as a means to ensure that care is available to everyone. The problem, as Canadians can attest, is that, in practice, it can mean that while more citizens are covered , their standard of care is lower. Under the Canadian system, a typical patient can expect to wait 20 weeks after seeing a doctor to begin treatment with a specialist. As imperfect as the US health system is, American patients rarely see wait times approaching this length. Too often, these delays can mean the difference between life and death. Perhaps that is why many Canadians end up crossing the border for US medical treatment. In many ways, the quality of health care in the US surpasses that of Canada and Western Europe.\n",
            "[Doc 841]: Compared to other countries, Americans are paying the most for their health care, yet their investment is not paying off. Study after study shows that Americans achieve worse health results than their peers in the developing world. A report published in the summer of 2017 compared the US with 11 similar countries and found that it fared the worst of the bunch. On access to care, equity and health care outcomes, the US ranked last, while only France was worse in administrative efficiency. At 77.9 years, US life expectance is towards the bottom of the OECD, behind poorer countries such as Chile. Nearly every developed country has achieved some form of universal health care. In the OECD, only the US and Mexico , one of the group’s poorest nations, fall short. From Israel to Australia to the UK, wealthy nations outside the US have embraced the single-payer system and have seen better results. Not to mention that Obamacare also guarantees coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions .\n",
            "[Doc 834]: While everyone stands to benefit from a more efficient health care system, the groups that may gain the most are the middle class and small business owners and workers. The current system provides government-sponsored health care for the poor and elderly through Medicare and Medicaid . Meanwhile, most workers in large corporations receive health care as part of their compensation as required under Obamacare . The people left behind are those between jobs, those working for small businesses and those looking to start or grow their own small business. Government-provided health care would make it easier for entrepreneurs to leave their jobs and start their own businesses, since they would not be putting their families’ health care at risk. It would make it easier to hire workers early on, since employees would be more willing to take a risk working at a new firm knowing that health care is provided. And if the business takes off, it would no longer face the threat of the employer mandate once it crosses a certain threshold, which Obamacare set at 50 workers.\n",
            "[Doc 2129]: Private-sector investment will provide crucial training for health professionals, infrastructure, and resources to improve maternal and child health care. Providing affordable maternal care acts as a means for promoting gender equality, and empowerment. Jacaranda Health  operate on a business model, meeting the demand, and need, for affordable and high-quality maternal care in East Africa. Through mobile clinics and new maternity hospitals Jacaranda Health is empowering women and children. Within the first year Jacaranda Health provided care for 4,000 women, and changed the lives of 20,000 families. Additionally, free maternal care holds negative side-effects. As Burundi shows, the social policy ideas implementing ‘free’ maternal health care resulted in overburdening the health resources and understaffed facilities; and putting vulnerable children at greater risk (IRIN, 2013).\n",
            "[Doc 3739]: Children with good health will long term save the government money on health care. Children happily drink fruit drinks. Parents should be made fully aware of this\n",
            "[Doc 809]: Americans may be willing to spend a little more money for the security of knowing they would receive quality health care. According to some estimates , the costs of enacting a single-payer system, though, would not just be high. They would be astronomical. Examining a past proposal by Senator Bernie Sanders, the non-partisan Urban Institute found that it would increase spending by $32 trillion over 10 years . The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget pegged the number even higher . According to the Washington Post , such a spending hike would require “a tax increase so huge that even the democratic socialist Mr. Sanders did not propose anything close to it.” The only way to square his proposal, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman noted, was with a “huge magic asterisk.”\n",
            "[Doc 401]: One of the tell-tale signs of a struggling nation is lack of investment. America’s infrastructure is crumbling. According to the infrastructure report card issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the majority of America’s infrastructure categories have received an overall grade of “D” for the last 20 years. Poor infrastructure has real consequences – lack of maintenance leads to increased accidents (and deaths, as with the Baltimore bridge collapse ) and inefficiency that cost billions of dollars. Health care is another weak point for America. True, America is not the only country that was caught unprepared for the pandemic. However, perhaps its current health care system, with high costs and low medical capacity, contributed to the country’s vulnerability. America has long needed to invest in improving its health care system so that it can better promote health and equality, especially compared to other countries.\n",

Quality and staff need to be regulated, with standards and prices set, but who will enforce regulation and how can we ensure rules are followed? Public-sector delivery protects patients from poor, dangerous, treatment. When looking at regulation in health care, the relationship between private healthcare provision, efficiency and quality is variable. Outcomes depend on the institutional settings (economic, political, and social) and what private actors are involved. Private health providers have a profit incentive to cut corners and provide the cheapest care they can while charging high prices. The theory of a virtuous cycle is far from the reality.\n",

Many major health organizations, such as the World Health Organization , CDC , and FDA , all say that vaccines are safe, relying on decades of studies to back up their claims. Medical experts, who have studied health for most of their professional lives, are overwhelmingly pro-vaccines as well, with some supporting them so strongly that they go as far as dismissing families from their practice if the parents refuse to vaccinate their kids. Of course, there are instances where doctors are wrong , but they are our best bet when it comes to safeguarding our children’s health. After all, they have dedicated their lives to studying and practicing medicine, overseeing the health and long lives of countless patients.\n",

Any individual with that much influence over an entire sector is concerning, as he shapes everything from the conversation surrounding global health to the decisions on which diseases to allocate what resources. The Foundation also has a multitude of partnerships with companies in the private sector involved in global health governance. This creates huge conflicts of interest when it comes to policy-making.

When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",

Children who see more of their parents often develop stronger relationships with their parents which are valuable in later life when they need advice or support.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1035]: There’s no concrete evidence showing that the death penalty actually deters crime. Various studies comparing crime and murder rates in U.S. states that have the death penalty versus those that don’t found that the murder rate in non-death-penalty states has actually remained consistently lower over the years than in those states that have the death penalty. These findings suggest that capital punishment may not actually be a deterrent for crime. The winds may be shifting regarding the public’s opinion about the death penalty. This is evident by the recent decision of a non-unanimous Florida jury to sentence the Parkland High School shooter to life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty . While the verdict shocked many, it also revealed mixed feelings about the death penalty, including among the families of the 17 Parkland victims and families of victims from other mass shootings.\n",
            "[Doc 2026]: While budget should not be the primary concern of the justice system, The death penalty, when applied properly, can be cheaper. A lethal injection, or a few bullets, costs far less than keeping a person incarcerated for a long time, especially if they need long term health or other care in old age. The longer someone is in jail the greater the cost to the state. The costs of the implementation of the death penalty are driven up by anti-death penalty activists using the appeals system. Since the death penalty would only be applied to the worst of the worst when there is absolute moral certainty there would be less need for extensive appeals because there would be less marginal cases.\n",
            "[Doc 118]: Contrary to popular belief, the death penalty is actually more expensive than keeping an inmate in prison, even for life. While the cost of the actual execution may be minimal, the overall costs surrounding a capital case (where the death penalty is a potential punishment) are enormously high. Sources say that defending a death penalty case can cost around four times higher than defending a case not seeking death. Even in cases where a guilty plea cancels out the need for a trial, seeking the death penalty costs almost twice as much as cases that don’t. And this is before factoring in appeals, which are more time-consuming and therefore cost more than life-sentence appeals, as well as higher prison costs for death-row inmates.\n",
            "[Doc 1885]: The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1.

The Constitution’s 8th and 14th Amendments recognize the death penalty BUT under due process of the law. This means that certain legal requirements must first be fulfilled before any state executions can be legally carried out – even when pertaining to the cruelest, most cold-blooded murderer . While interpretations of the amendments pertaining to the death penalty have changed over the years, the Founding Fathers intended to allow for the death penalty from the very beginning and put in place a legal system to ensure due process.\n",
            "[Doc 1886]: There are an alarming number of wrongful convictions associated with the death penalty1. So far, more than 130 people who had been sentenced to death have been exonerated2. In many cases, unlike those who have been sentenced to life in prison, it is impossible to compensate executed prisoners should they later be proven innocent. The state should not gamble with people's lives. The chance of wrongful execution alone should be enough to prove the death penalty is not justifiable. \"EU Policy Against the Death penalty.\" Accessed June 5, 2011. Accessed June 5, 2011.\n",
            "[Doc 2921]: The opposition house believes that death penalty is an inefficient measure to avoid the effects of terrorist acts that cause death. Instead of, this house proposes other kind of measures as imprisonment with psychological treatment. This will ensure the social rehabilitation of the charged of terrorist acts and the possibility that has every human being, to defend him and be able to recognize his mistakes. In that case, the person will be able to attempt in front of the judicial authorities his freedom, and return to the society. This is also adequate because judicial authorities can be wrong at the moment they condemn the person who is charged to commit terrorist acts. Anyway, even the judge is human, and he can be wrong at the moment he appreciates the facts that are not favorable to the suspect. His lawyer, maybe, is not enough prepared to make the defense (fact than can be checked in almost all the undeveloped countries) and this can lead to an adverse decision. If the suspect is condemned and the death penalty is executed, there won’t be any possible remedy to this flaw, and that means that an irreversible measure should always be a completely correct decision. A human decision, like the judge’s, that ever can be reviewed, will never be completely sure. On the other hand, imprisonment will always be a reversible measure and, as this house already stated, it can be effective to penalize a person who actually committed terrorist acts that cause death. This is wider fair, because we literally don’t sacrifice any innocent people’s right. Finally, this house strongly believes that imprisonment in opposition of the death penalty is efficient to accomplish not only the punishment but also the social rehabilitation. In that order, we erase the fault and not the person.\n",

Of course there will always be inequality but this does not mean we should ban a good service for some on the basis that it is not available to all.

            "[Doc 1007]: The death penalty guarantees that convicted murderers will never kill again. There have been countless cases where convicts sentenced to life in prison have murdered other inmates and/or prison guards. Convicts have also been known to successfully arrange murders from within prison, the most famous case being mobster Whitey Bulger , who apparently was killed by fellow inmates while incarcerated. There are also cases where convicts who have been released for parole after serving only part of their sentences – even life sentences – have murdered again after returning to society. A death sentence is the only irrevocable penalty that protects innocent lives.\n",
            "[Doc 1894]: When confronted with chronic pain or with diseases that steadily remove our sense of self – or at least the self of whom we are aware – death has proven to be a sensible option taken by sensible people . It is a simple fact that we all die, our objections to it tend to be based on the idea that it can happen at the hands of others or at a time, or in a manner, not of our choosing. Neither of these issues arise with either assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia. Proposition has no difficulty at all with the suggestion that both procedures should be regulated and take place in safe, medically supported, environments. However, if an individual accepts that death is their preferred option in such a scenario, it is difficult to comprehend of reasons why they should not be allowed to proceed. Our social rejection of murder does not, ultimately relate to death itself but to the denial of choice. With murder someone is denying that person all their future potential so denying their freedom of choice, and this remains the case even if the murder was completely painless. Here, reason tells us, the virtuous act is death and the reservation of that choice. The determining element of humanity is that we are rational beings; a blanket ban – legal and social – on choosing the time and manner of our deaths reflects our primeval fear of a death that comes, unwanted, in the dark of the night, not the mature judgement of modern, thinking (and long-lived) humans.

            "[Doc 881]: For most people, life is sacred, and innocent lives should be valued over the lives of killers. Innocent victims who have been murdered – and in some cases, tortured beforehand – had no choice in their untimely and cruel death or any opportunity to say goodbye to friends and family, prepare wills, or enjoy their last moments of life. Meanwhile, convicted murderers sentenced to life in prison – and even those on death row – are still able to learn, read, write , paint, find religion, watch TV, listen to music, maintain relationships, and even appeal their sentences. To many, capital punishment symbolizes justice and is the only way to adequately express society’s revulsion of the murder of innocent lives. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center Poll, the majority of US adults ( 60% ) think that legal executions fit the crime of what convicted killers deserve.

            "[Doc 226]: By definition, death is the cessation of life – so, by all logic, there is no life after death. In this vein, physics professor Sean Carroll contends that life after death is impossible. While there are many things we don’t know about the world, he says, we do know about the particles that make up the human body – and those don’t go anywhere after the body dies. Because consciousness is part of the physical body, it dies along with the rest of a person. Unlike other uncertainties in life, this concept is relatively straightforward: With death, life ends.\n",

We are piling on the misery to demand that relatives allow their loved ones to be cut open and their organs harvested. The last thing people want at that time is to be asked to make an agonising decision about whether someone else should be able to benefit from their son or daughter’s death. If the donor has consented beforehand its one thing, but it is heartless and deeply upsetting to ask that people be made to opt-out at the moment of bereavement.\n",
            "[Doc 2082]: A system of just law is not based on opinions or ideologies. It is about finding evidence and using that evidence to prove or disprove either to 'beyond reasonable doubt' for criminal cases or 'on the balance of probabilities' for civil and commercial matters. The burden is on the importance of the evidence. It does not make sense for a legal system to on one hand place so much emphasis on evidence and lock away documents which will contain a vast array of empirical evidence with the other. Instead, attorney-client privilege should be abolished and all evidence should be in justices domain in order to ensure that the law achieves a just result.\n",
            "[Doc 3835]: Another question to argue about is that, is it moral to use death-row prisoners as guinea pigs for medical experiment? The propostion never showed us why it's morally justified to do so. To force anyone to be experimented for medical research without their informed consent is both illegal and immoral. Medical ethics requires doctors or pharmacautical companies to conduct their experiments with the informed consent from patients or volunteers, which means that an individual should be fully informed about the potential harms or benefits an experiments would like to bring. We think there's no point that such a basic moral principle could be tramped, this should be applied equally to both general public and prisoners, for the latter group although being deprived of their freedom or life, there's no justification why they also deprived the right to manage their own body. It should be a basic working ethics abide by doctors and pharmacautical manufactures.\n",
            "[Doc 1912]: People die in accidents and by natural cause all of the time. However, it is much rarer for a person to be actively involved in another person’s death. If one chooses to pull the lever and change the course of the train then one is actively participating in the death of the one person.

While, in 2020, the number of black leads has risen to 39.7%, it still shows disproportionate representation.

For example, the film Hidden Figures , depicts a black NASA mathematician whose success is sponsored by her benevolent white boss. Similar dynamics occur in the movies The Blind Side , The Help, and 2018’s controversial Oscar winner , Green Book , among others.

Should toddlers get the vote because health services affect them? No - we trust parents to cast votes after thinking about the interests of their families. And there are other ways for young people to have a say - they can write to elected representatives and newspapers, sign petitions, speak at public meetings, join youth parliaments, etc. It is notable that sixteen year olds themselves are divided on whether they should have the vote,  if many of them trust their parents to vote for them should not the government?\n",
            "[Doc 919]: Voting is a privilege, and people should be careful when exercising it. America may be a democracy, but that doesn’t mean that just anyone should have a say in who the president is. Convicted felons , minors, and, in many states, those considered incompetent are not given the right to vote at all. Why? Because on a societal level, we want the people electing our leadership to be trustworthy, well-informed and have good judgment. The EC does just that, as it allows citizens to appoint a body of representatives with sound judgment and values to elect an American president they deem fit for the position.\n",
            "[Doc 3753]: The judgment does not actually mean that prisoners have to have the vote as under the European Convention the right to vote is a very qualified right. Up until 2000 there was a blanket ban, but now people on remand before conviction or sentence can vote because they have a home address. It would be unfair that a whole prison's worth of voters could sway a council or a general election because the prison is so large it would affect the constituency size and count as a large part of the voters in the constituency and it would marginalise the votes of law abiding citizens in constituencies.\n",
            "[Doc 3701]: A persons views on society and how it should be run is based on their parents. This is because during childhood, the only experience with society that the child has had has been influenced or arranged by their parents. Consequently, if we allow children to vote, all we are doing is giving parents more than their own vote. Parents will be able to influence their child's vote, even if not directly.\n",
            "[Doc 3032]: In todays times a vast majority of people don't relly care about what's happening in politics, or simply don't care enough to vote thinking that their one vote won't change anything. If there was compulsory voting I believe that more people would take an interest in politics and make their vote count for something.\n",
            "[Doc 558]: America was founded on a set of principles laid out by the Founding Fathers, one of which being that any president who wins an election through the majority of electoral votes has earned the legitimacy to preside over America. The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution provides that legitimacy, by ensuring that the president is elected by a majority vote – which doesn’t necessarily happen with the popular vote. For example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 election, accruing 48.2% of the vote in comparison to Trump’s 46.1%; the rest of the votes were split across candidates from independent parties. In other words, neither Trump nor Clinton got the majority of the popular vote. The EC serves to ensure that one candidate has a majority win and is therefore deserving of the presidency. Changing the entire political system that has always defined America could have drastic, unintended consequences.\n",

            "[Doc 1874]: The European Union should not be interfering with individual member’s electoral systems, it is clear that this is an area where it is up to the members to decide who can vote and when. Even when it comes to elections for the European Parliament it is up to each member to decide the form of the election within certain ground rules. It would quickly be seen as illegitimate to allow sixteen and seventeen year olds the vote in some elections and not others without a good justification. As the level of election that is most distant from the individual if there were to be a discrepancy in voting ages it should logically be the other way around with the most abstract vote being granted last.\n",
            "[Doc 3034]: Voting holds a special place in a democracy; it is the very foundation of the mandate our elected representatives hold. To turn it into something everyone over the age of 18 must do would take away something from that. staying at home) sends a more powerful signal of apathy than does a spoilt ballot or abstention vote; a non-vote says that the citizen is dissatisfied with the entire process, that politics do not address any concern she has. A spoilt ballot or abstention vote in a compulsory election, however, merely expresses dissatisfaction with the particular candidates in the constituency, and hides the deeper malaise that may be there. Compulsory voting merely sweeps under the carpet the legitimate dissatisfaction many people feel with politics, and will not lead to the regeneration of politics that its proponents suggest. Many people will merely vote at random, because 'they have to', rather than expressing their apathy. A person who conciously elects, in their own mind, that they do not wish to participate in an election process, for whatever reason(s) they may have, should not be legally obliged to vote or in any way participate if they choose not to do so.\n",
            "[Doc 3752]: The thing that we have to worry about in giving prisoners the right to vote is the possibility of the police influencing their votes. Given that the prison is such a closed away building from society as it is, how can we ensure that the votes cast in the prisons are legitimate? Any unused votes could be used by office guards themselves. Alternatively, police could exert undue influence over the prisoners and how they vote. Prisoners could be enticed to vote a certain way. This serves no purpose than giving the police more votes than they are entitled to.\n",
            "[Doc 1938]: Perhaps the most basic and fundamental of all our rights. However, with every right comes a choice. The right to speech does not remove the option to remain silent; the right to vote brings with it the right to abstain. In the same way, the right to choose to die is implicit in the right to life. The degree to which physical pain and psychological distress can be tolerated is different in all humans. Quality of life judgements are private and personal, thus only the sufferer can make relevant decisions. People are given a large degree of autonomy within their lives and since deciding to end your life does not physically harm anyone else, it should be within your rights to decide when you wish to die. While the act of suicide does remove option to choose life, most cases in which physician assisted suicide is reasonable, death is the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process. The choice for the patient, therefore, is not to die, but to cease suffering and tto chose the time and manner of their death.\n",
            "[Doc 2750]: The numbers of young people's interest is ridiculously low. How should we address this? One way would be to allow younger people the vote, as it would encourage them to investigate further into how it all works. Some may not be interested at all, thats fine. But should we really obstruct the opportunities for those interested in learning more? I think it is important for young people to be interested in politics as will affect them hugely at some point in their lives, therefore we should offer 16s and over the vote.\n",
            "[Doc 3036]: Would you force someone to vote even if they were actively uninterested in politics? Even if they were determined to cross a random box? Even if they did not even know the political party in power/opposition? If you force everyone to vote you make it a criminal offence to be incredibly apathetic, so the incredibly apathetic people will merely vote insensibly, counting against the people who are actually voting on the basis of informed opinion. In an extreme case, idiots could sway the result of an election. If your not even bothered enough about the future of your country's government to even turn up at the polling booth at each general election, then you don't get a say, and I think thats actually good. Forcing uninterested people to vote is not really democratic its just random. You might want to decide who's in power by throwing the dice instead.\n",
            "[Doc 1868]: Modern liberal democracy is founded on the idea that people should be free to decide their own leaders and their own futures, but not all states give their minority peoples such a right. However, this is a right guaranteed under international law. The International Court of Justice has held that this right applies not just to national governments but also people1. The two important United Nations studies on the right to self-determination set out factors of a people that give rise to possession of right to self-determination: a history of independence or self-rule in an identifiable territory, a distinct culture, and a will and capability to regain self-governance2. If these criteria are in place, such peoples should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangements.\n",
            "[Doc 1247]: It is true that animals and human beings are different. It is also true that men are different from women and children from adults. Equality does not require beings to be identical. It is true that whilst many people argue women should have the right to abortion, no one argues the same for men because men are unable to have an abortion. It is similarly true that whilst most people believe all human beings have a right to vote, no one argues that animals deserve a right to vote – even those who support animal rights. Equality does not mean that beings all deserve the exact same treatment. It means rather that we consider equally the equal interests of animals and humans. If we deem amount A to be the maximum amount of suffering a person be allowed to endure, then that should apply equally to an animal, though humans and animals may suffer different amounts under different circumstances. The principle of equality advocates equal consideration, so it still allows for different treatment and different rights. Equality is a prescriptive rather than a descriptive concept. What’s important is that beings should ONLY be treated differently where there is a morally relevant difference between them. For example, we can justifiably deny dogs the right to vote because there is a relevant difference in intelligence between dogs and humans. However, there is no justification for battery-farming chickens who have a capacity to suffer. There is evidence that they experience fear, pain and discomfort. Although chickens may be less intelligent and unable to speak , these differences are not morally relevant to whether or not they should be placed in these conditions. We ought to consider animals equally to the way we consider humans. If we were to do so we would give animals rights. We ought therefore to give animals rights.\n",
            "[Doc 3938]: Whether it is planning the next terror plot or planning a bank heist, the only people who benefit from the internet privacy are criminals. While it does have some benefits for everyone else, criminals benefit disproportionality for it. They are able to manipulate it and thus stay off the radar of law enforcement. As more tools continue to develop for improving internet privacy, so do the likelihood of successful criminal activity. In short, if you have nothing to hide, internet privacy should not be such a concern to you. Law enforcers have enough training to know not to misuse any information they gather about your private life on the internet.\n",
            "[Doc 1791]: It is their right to select the criteria for making decisions. Even though it is assumed, certain criteria exist such as prior experience or party affiliation. However, some citizens might turn to astrology or tarot cards to decide their vote. Others may consider a candidate’s religion or appearance. Many decide based upon the opinion of respected others. However much one might personally dislike some of these criteria, every citizen has a right to determine the basis of her/his vote. Therefore opinion polls are a legitimate choice to provide.\n",
            "[Doc 881]: For most people, life is sacred, and innocent lives should be valued over the lives of killers. Innocent victims who have been murdered – and in some cases, tortured beforehand – had no choice in their untimely and cruel death or any opportunity to say goodbye to friends and family, prepare wills, or enjoy their last moments of life. Meanwhile, convicted murderers sentenced to life in prison – and even those on death row – are still able to learn, read, write , paint, find religion, watch TV, listen to music, maintain relationships, and even appeal their sentences. To many, capital punishment symbolizes justice and is the only way to adequately express society’s revulsion of the murder of innocent lives. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center Poll, the majority of US adults ( 60% ) think that legal executions fit the crime of what convicted killers deserve. The death penalty is a way to restore society’s balance of justice – by showing that the most severe crimes are intolerable and will be punished in kind\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 902]: From his first voyage West, Columbus displayed a propensity for cruelty and dehumanization . Columbus’s first report to Queen Isabella concluded that the Taino tribesmen of the West Indies were “dirty” and “ fit to be ruled .” In keeping with his belief of native inferiority, Columbus established the New World’s first ecomienda , a tribute system which amounted to slavery for the natives he “inherited”; Columbus then popularized this system of feudal peonage himself by gifting land grants to Spanish settlers. Slavery wasn’t Columbus’s only pastime – Spanish missionary Bartalome de Casas lamented that Columbus literally threw people to the dogs . Columbus’s brutality was so well known that the Spanish crown deposed him for floggings and extrajudicial executions of Spanish settlers. This is to say that the monarchs who led the Spanish Inquisition and literally burned people at the stake , felt Columbus was too cruel for a title in the Spanish court. Think on that.\n",
            "[Doc 957]: Christopher Columbus’s auspicious rise to power and fame is a slice of pull-yourself-up-from-your-bootstraps Americana. Columbus was born to a landless Italian wool worker and started working his way up on merchant ships as a teenager. He secured his own education, and studied cartography, mathematics, astronomy and navigation along the sea shores where he worked. Columbus was imperturbable in his efforts to find a patron to sponsor the voyage. He pitched his idea to monarchs in Portugal, France, and England before finally securing the support of Spain’s Ferdinand and Isabella, who named him admiral and viceroy.\n",
            "[Doc 1034]: Renaissance historian William J. Connell points out that it would be remiss to judge Christopher Columbus’ actions against modern standards. Whereas using war captives as slaves would be unthinkable today, it had been common practice in Europe since the time of Aristotle. And although modern societies deride any form of compelled conversion, for fifteenth-century Christians, bringing savages under Christ’s dominion was considered an act of mercy and piety. Columbus and his royal patroness, Queen Isabella , doubtless believed that they were saving the inhabitants of the New World from eternal damnation and bestowing upon them the gift of civilization.\n",
            "[Doc 33]: Columbus’s accomplishments were not owing to his capabilities but to his penchant for ineptitude and miscalculation . Columbus’s initial mission was to discover an express route to Asia via the Atlantic. For reasons which are obvious today, Columbus never did discover such a route, nor did he discover the gold, gems, or spices that he’d promised in abundance to his Spanish patrons. He had no talent for geography . Columbus insisted Cuba was Japan and then China . He was convinced that the Bahamas were islands off the coast of India (hence, the geographical misnomer “West Indies”). Even his first colony was established by default when he was forced to leave behind castaway crewmen from his wrecked flagship Santa Maria .\n",
            "[Doc 638]: Contrary to the view of the New World as a sprawling expanse of untraversed wilderness, the Americas were home to millions of inhabitants. Columbus’s arrival signaled a dramatic upheaval, and they were quickly decimated by European diseases and warfare, enslavement, and cultural and political subjugation. It’s estimated that within 20 years of Columbus’s arrival to Hispaniola (today’s Haiti), the native population had shrunk to 11,000 from 300,000 . This Columbus-style “Euroization” of native populations continued for centuries and ultimately resulted in the eradication of hundreds of civilizations across the Western Hemisphere.\n",
            "[Doc 1058]: Through the course of his many voyages, and the news of his voyages, which inspired countless other expeditions, Columbus initiated the Columbian Exchange , the transfer of ideas, plants, animals, technologies, and cultures across the Atlantic divide. These interactions greatly impacted the peoples on both sides of the ocean. In fact, the introduction of New World plants into European and Asian diets was foundational to the population booms that followed. Columbus’s voyages constituted the world’s first steps toward globalization. This process has transformed humanity, sometimes introducing conflict, but has also engendered cooperation and meaningful exchanges that have encouraged positive developments for people in every corner of the globe.\n",

Fallible umpire calls are part of the drama of baseball. Many people enjoy the excitement that comes with the fallibility of umpire's calls.

He was the first president to introduce Hindu customs into the White House, or to wish Persian Americans a happy new year in Farsi. He also strengthened LGTB rights , paving the way for marriage equality and anti-discrimination legislation. No president better reflected America’s diversity, or honored it so single-mindedly as he.\n",
            "[Doc 2411]: Many studies failed to control for factors that contribute to children becoming violent, such as family history and mental health, plus most studies do not follow children over long periods of time. Video game experiments often have people playing a game for as little as ten minutes, which is not representative of how games are played in real life. In many laboratory studies, especially those involving children, researchers must use artificial measures of violence and aggression that do not translate to real-world violence and aggression, such as whether someone would force another person eat hot sauce or listen to unpleasant noises. According to Christopher J. Ferguson, PhD, a psychology professor at Stetson University, \"matching video game conditions more carefully in experimental studies with how they are played in real life makes VVG's effects on aggression essentially vanish.\"\n",
            "[Doc 285]: Celebrating the art of someone accused (or guilty) of abuse of any sort sends the message of caring more for the artist than for their victim(s). This is especially true when both artist and victim are still alive. Woody Allen’s daughter Dylan, who claims that Allen molested her , wrote an open letter expressing her pain that Allen was honored by people who know what he did to her. Let’s also remember that, besides the victor in Bill Cosby’s retrial, other women had separately accused him of sexual assault . Though on a much different scale than Cosby, comedian Louis C.K. also has a list of victims he exposed to sexual harassment, who deserve consideration before society welcomes his comeback attempts . So, watching a TV show, or paying to watch a movie, enter an exhibition or download a song inevitably means giving certain artists money and recognition that they don’t deserve.\n",
            "[Doc 3615]: In my opinion, smoking should be banned in public places. That is because non-smokers should not be forced to secondhand smoke against their will. Even though it is an obvious etiquette not to smoke when surrounded by many people, a large number of smokers don't seem to care so much about it. For example, it's not that hard to find a person smoking at a bus stop even if there are little girls around him/her. There should be rules restricting people who have little regard for the well-being of others. Another reason why smoking should be banned in public places is because of the garbage problem. Not many smokers throw away their cigarette butts into the trash cans. Most of them just toss it on the streets. The streets will be much cleaner if smoking is banned. However, smokers should not be treated unfairly. There should be more places where only smokers can smoke freely. Therefore smoking should be banned in public places but more smoking areas should be built as well.\n",
            "[Doc 3534]: Whilst it is true that some cannot afford to give thier children a private education this should not mean that the institutions should be abolished completely! This is equivalent to arguing that as some cannot afford Ferraris they should cease production. Of course there will always be inequality but this does not mean we should ban a good service for some on the basis that it is not available to all. Yes, perhaps we should try to make it more accesible through scholarships and bursaries etc, and perhaps one day it will be available for all, but until then it would be a step backwards to abolish private education.

            "[Doc 1512]: Gender selection technology should be available, at whatever cost the market dictates, to those who can afford the process and wish to choose the sex of their children. There should be no other restrictions on the couples wishing to go through with the process, other than an assurance that the mother is physically able and willing. As it is not an essential procedure, the state should not be expected to subsidize either the process or the development of the technology. Nevertheless, the private sector should be encouraged to develop the technology and continue to provide the public with a path to maximise their own happiness.\n",

I think students should have the right of bringing a cellphone to school because its theirs. if they dont cause trouble with it i think they should be allowed because also it is really convenient for emergencies and also the school phones might be out or they might not have access to one so it think bringing a cell phone is handy also you could use it to help for your classes like a calculator or as a flashlight.

            "[Doc https://www.worldhistory.org/Christopher_Columbus/]: Columbus never set out to discover a New World, but to find a western sea route to the Far East to facilitate trade after the land route of the Silk Road, between Europe and the East, had been closed by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 CE, initiating the so-called Age of Exploration (also known as the Age of Discovery) which launched many European sea expeditions. The magnetic compass was known in Europe by 1180 CE and, using ancient texts such as Strabo's *Geography* and Pliny the Elder's *Natural History* as well as long-established maps, European pilots were able to navigate the waters and continue trade with the East via the Black Sea. Columbus, basing his calculations on Toscanelli's map, & Marco Polo's work, estimated the distance from the Canary Islands to Cathay at around 2,300 miles. **Second Voyage - 1493-1496 CE**: Columbus arrived back in the New World as governor of the lands he had claimed with a fleet of 17 ships full of colonists to establish communities for Spain as well as a number of dogs to be used in subduing the natives.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 371]: Clinton’s time in office saw the US involved in no major conflicts for a significant period – other than to lead NATO in halting war in Bosnia. While the country intervened in other small ways overseas, this never led to full-on war the likes of which is successors saw. Clinton was a president that preferred negotiation to intervention. In fact, he got incredibly close to brokering a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. Clinton also managed to negotiate with North Korea – his Agreed Framework of 1994 kept nuclear weapons out of their hands for eight years.\n",
            "[Doc 1205]: Bill Clinton hugely undercut the American welfare system. He reduced the amount of American families that received welfare from 4 million to 1.6 million, and his policies contributed to benefits falling by 32.5% . Clinton believed that a strong economy would lift Americans out of the need for welfare, but he was deeply mistaken. At the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, 8 million people were left with only food stamps as income. Today, there are over 11 million children and teenagers living in deep poverty, partly because of his administration.\n",
            "[Doc 837]: Bill Clinton laid the foundation for today’s prison-industrial complex and bolstered the war on drugs . Excessively tough on crime, his policies had an especially adverse effect on black communities. He introduced crime bills such as the “three strikes” law, which made three felony convictions result in a life sentence. Penalizing petty and non-violent crime with mandatory minimum sentences became the norm, as several states took inspiration from Clinton’s crime strategy. Over his tenure, the prison population doubled from 600,000 to 1.2 million people – an incredibly high human cost for an insufficient result .\n",
            "[Doc 1198]: Clinton enacted intelligent fiscal policy , transforming a national deficit of $290 billion in 1992 to a national surplus of $236.4 billion by 2000. He increased taxes on the upper-middle class and large corporations. Ending subsidies for some companies and generally reforming the tax code, Clinton raised huge amounts of money for the government. Smart spending cuts ensured that the government would save instead of racking up debt, which created the largest national surplus in America’s history.\n",
            "[Doc 1950]: The government is here to serve the people. The concept behind a referendum is public sovereignty, the people themselves are the ones who get to decide. Having had one referendum it has already been agreed that this is an issue where it should not be up to our representatives in Parliament to decide, rather it is an issue for direct democracy. Having started the issue, the people have a right to determine the result. In Parliament there is not just a single vote on an issue. Rather there are three readings of a bill in each house. Then there is consideration of amendments from the house that did not initiate the bill often with parliamentary ping pong. Throughout this MPs get multiple opportunities to vote, both on the whole bill and on individual amendments.\n",
            "[Doc 1625]: Homophobia in Uganda was not introduced by this law. Refusing to sign the bill into law would result in increased brutality and cruelty to the LGBT minority from the majority of citizens who were angry that president Museveni even considered vetoing the bill. Shortly after the president’s letter to parliament requesting the shelving of the bill was revealed, thousands of Ugandans took on to the streets protesting against the move complaining that homosexuality will never be allowed in their society. Known gay Ugandans were forced not to move while others were attacked in their homes. Long before the bill was passed by parliament, homosexuals and LGBT activists were beaten, harassed and killed by their fellow Ugandans. David Kato a leading figure in demanding equal rights for the gay minority was killed in January 2011. The situation may have worsened had the bill been shelved as angry Ugandans would attack the gay community seeking revenge, something that they made clear would happen during the anti-gay protests. Most Ugandans had supported a death penalty for homosexuals and clearly have few qualms about launching attacks, sometimes murderous against homosexuals.\n",
            "[Doc 7]: Bill Clinton introduced what would become a trend of transferring jobs outside of the US. His export agreement with China and NAFTA enabled American companies to profit from cheap labor abroad. Around 700,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared. Corporations became more likely to cut wages and benefits. Additionally, the cheap sale of farm products to Mexico put millions of Mexicans out of work and boosted their coming to America illegally.\n",
            "[Doc 2328]: What this bill allows is for the facts to be taught and then seen through the lens of various theories. The bill requires that the schools within the state remain within the state science curriculum. It “protects the teaching of scientific information, and shall not be construed to promote any religious or non-religious doctrine”. The result therefore is that this Tennessee law opens up academic enquiry and science rather than shutting it down as opponents claim.\n",
            "[Doc 558]: America was founded on a set of principles laid out by the Founding Fathers, one of which being that any president who wins an election through the majority of electoral votes has earned the legitimacy to preside over America. The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution provides that legitimacy, by ensuring that the president is elected by a majority vote – which doesn’t necessarily happen with the popular vote. For example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 election, accruing 48.2% of the vote in comparison to Trump’s 46.1%; the rest of the votes were split across candidates from independent parties. In other words, neither Trump nor Clinton got the majority of the popular vote. The EC serves to ensure that one candidate has a majority win and is therefore deserving of the presidency. Changing the entire political system that has always defined America could have drastic, unintended consequences.\n",
            "[Doc 305]: Too often, US military action is judged against a perfect alternative. Yet, while intervention has its drawbacks and complications, failing to act often carries an even steeper price. Avoiding confrontation sometimes puts American citizens at risk. President Clinton had the chance to kill Osama bin Laden several times but did not pull the trigger. A strike that killed al-Qaeda’s leader but resulted in civilian casualties may have earned criticism – indeed, it may have ended up in the other half of this column – but it could have prevented the 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and avoided a long, protracted war in Afghanistan. Then, there are the humanitarian costs of inaction. Clinton called his failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda, where 800,000 people were killed in just two months, one of his biggest regrets . And what do Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden think about Syria, where over 300K people have been killed since 2011.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 1624]: More than 90% of Uganda’s population believe that homosexuality is not part of their culture and should never be accepted, its seen as  indecency, criminality and a taboo in the community. This is something the government did not invent and not something it can simply wash out of society. Shelving the bill would not suddenly create tolerance from Ugandan society towards the gay community but instead would isolate and impose a threat to the LGBT community. Others would have tried to create laws anti-gay laws. This ‘kill the Gays bill’ was originally intended to include the death penalty for some homosexual acts such as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\". Any wider change to the culture of the country is not the duty of the government.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 466]: Clinton created more jobs than any president in US history. In 1992, the year before he took office, unemployment was at 7.5%. His policies reduced it to 4% by the time he left the White House. Over his eight years as president, 23.2 million jobs were created, at an average of 242,000 per month. Wages increased, the rate of homeownership reached a historic high of 67.7%, and the poverty rate fell to 11.8%. Also, between 1993 and 1999, the real median family income went up by around $6,000.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 2327]: This bill that opens the door to creationism is really about changing the way that teaching is done to make it more critical and analytical. This is an improvement in scientific education as it will help ensure that science is about critical, constructive discourse rather than just imbibing ‘facts’. That would not be education, it would be indoctrination.\n",
            "[Doc 1009]: It may be hard to imagine former president Trump and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or current President Biden and current House Speaker Kevin McCarthy kicking off their shoes after work and knocking back a glass of whiskey together, but that is exactly how Reagan and House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Democrat, ended their day. And his aisle-crossing was not limited to happy hour. His immigration reform bill signed in 1986 allowed amnesty for those who entered the country before 1982. He also worked with O’Neill on a deficit reduction bill that increased taxes . Some of these actions were not popular among Reagan’s base, but they won over the electorate at large. Reagan won both his elections by a landslide, and in his re-election came with the most electoral votes in history. And Americans’ view of the Gipper has only improved with time. He also won over people’s hearts and appreciation by publicly sharing his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in 1994.\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 1427]: Perhaps the most important values in the Philippines are social harmony and respect for the family. Allowing contraception will take away a psychological barrier that prevents pre-marital or casual sex and once that barrier is crossed the individual will have higher sexual activity. In terms of politics these values mean support for democracy but also being against corruption and graft. The Reproductive Health bill represents the worst excesses of the pork barrel buffet. With a single-mindedness of purpose, the presidential palace has put everything on the table to shore up the votes required in parliament. Legislators, who had previously voted against the legislation, often repeatedly, where threatened with the loss of programmes in their constituencies if they failed to back the project, which has been at the heart of the presidential agenda .\n",

The committee is seeking information about Epstein's history, after President Donald Trump's administration decided against releasing more federal files on the dead financier. Amid a rift between Trump and some of his supporters on Epstein, the committee, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, recently voted to issue the subpoenas. Comer wrote in letters to each person that the committee must \"conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr Epstein\" and Maxwell. The committee is seeking all of the department's documents and communications on Epstein and Maxwell \"relating or referring to human trafficking, exploitation of minors, sexual abuse, or related activity\", as well as files from the US criminal cases against Maxwell and Epstein, documents from a 2007 agreement to not prosecute Epstein and federal investigations into the former financier.

According to the infrastructure report card issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the majority of America’s infrastructure categories have received an overall grade of “D” for the last 20 years. Poor infrastructure has real consequences – lack of maintenance leads to increased accidents (and deaths, as with the Baltimore bridge collapse ) and inefficiency that cost billions of dollars. Health care is another weak point for America. True, America is not the only country that was caught unprepared for the pandemic. However, perhaps its current health care system, with high costs and low medical capacity, contributed to the country’s vulnerability. America has long needed to invest in improving its health care system so that it can better promote health and equality, especially compared to other countries.\n",

His export agreement with China and NAFTA enabled American companies to profit from cheap labor abroad. Around 700,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared.

The world once again came close to nuclear brinkmanship in 1962, during the faceoff between America and the Soviet Union off the shores of Cuba.

I automatically look for their motive and find ways in which their actions aren't purely evil, and where the situation could have been resolved without killing them or completely wrecking their life's work. In films where 'the hero wins' and 'the villain loses', the morality is entirely bipolar, teaching children that some people are good and some people are evil and we shouldn't question this. This kind of thinking isn't what we need in a situation where it has already caused wars. In original versions of fairy tales, the morality is often quite complex, with main characters performing evil actions, the most unsympathetic people turning out not to be evil and nothing being as it seems.

(This is in addition to around 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed as a result of the bombing.) Meanwhile, Nagasaki’s death toll is estimated between 40,000-80,000 . Among the civilian deaths in Nagasaki, it is estimated that 6,200 out of the 7,500 employees of the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, and 24,000 other civilians (including 2,000 Koreans) who worked in other war factories and plants in Nagasaki.

In the past there was no permanent framework for dealing with grave breaches of human rights protection, often allowing states to perform evil acts with impunity. Only for the very worst atrocities were special courts and tribunals set up. It should also act as a deterrent to future violations; it may not reduce conflict but will encourage states to keep a tighter rein on their militaries.

Like Buddhism, Hinduism, the Abrahamic religions and countless others, Scientology attempts to help man reconcile his lesser demons and cultivate positive behavior. It provides an origin story for the ills of man, and it is arguably no more (or less) far-fetched than those espoused by other religions. (Who’s to say that an intergalactic explosion of alien spirits is a less plausible beginning of human evil than a snake talking a woman into eating a piece of fruit?) In form and function, Scientology is a religion like any other.\n",

            "[Doc 584]: Despite the number of Japanese casualties, many believe that by dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives around the world were saved . By the end of the war, the total number of US Army troops who were dead or missing in the Pacific and southeast Asia was 41,592, with an additional 145,706 ground troops wounded. Not to mention that around 9,000 British, Indian and Commonwealth soldiers were killed or wounded in the Far East, with another 130,000 captured. Meanwhile, the Marine Corps and Navy corpsmen in this region suffered total casualties of 23,160 killed or missing and 67,199 wounded. On the Japanese side, let’s look at the results of a B-29 incendiary raid over Tokyo . Just one of these raids (of which there were a few) killed about 125,000 people. This suggests that two of these raids would have been equivalent to the total amount of casualties that resulted from the atomic bombs. In the Potsdam Declaration, the countries against Japan stated that if Japan didn’t surrender, it would face “prompt and utter destruction,” so it’s safe to say that if the war against Japan hadn’t ended when it did, there would have been more such raids. Historians suggest that the 250,000 casualties from the atomic bombs could have easily reached millions if they hadn’t been dropped.\n",

Just like slave traders or concentration camp guards had no care for the humans they tortured. To be fair researchers aren't inhumane, evil and intentionally cruel people. They have worked and studied for years believing that animal testing is the best way forward. By the time they have graduated, it is so hard-wired into their way of thinking that it is next to impossible to convince them otherwise. Generally, they try hard to make conditions better for the animals they test on but often aren't allowed to change conditions too much for fear of skewing the results. Government regulations also state that animal testing is obligatory before any tests can be carried out on human beings. It's sad but true.

            "[Doc 892]: Snowden’s decision upended his life and career. He risked his own freedom to bring information into the public domain about the US government endangering its citizens’ civil liberties. Even former US Attorney General Eric Holder, who believes Snowden is a traitor, admitted that he “performed a public service .” He knew acting upon his conviction to uphold the sanctity of American values would force him into a life on the run , but he leaked the information anyway. enough changed for the good since Snowden’s act of courage?\n",
            "[Doc 218]: Edward Snowden leaked documents that showed the existence and shocking extent of a global mass surveillance system that the US government used to spy on the personal communications of millions – if not hundreds of millions – of Americans and foreign citizens with no links to terrorism. This system included private emails, phone conversations, web histories, etc. – all without consent or court warrants. Snowden’s decision to share this information consequently prompted a global debate over surveillance techniques and protecting citizens’ privacy . This, in turn, resulted in the US government passing laws for the first time in decades restricting government surveillance. As part of the far-reaching consequences of Snowden’s actions, technology companies like WhastApp and Apple have also done more to encrypt and protect users’ personal information. None of this would have happened without Snowden.\n",
            "[Doc 909]: Snowden acted responsibly when he revealed that the NSA’s surveillance program was unconstitutional. He was careful in not leaking any details about the algorithms that the NSA used in its operations. Nor did the leaks reveal the identities of the groups or individuals that the agency had targeted or the US agents involved. The leaked data also didn’t contain any details of US military plans or conversations between US or foreign officials. Therefore, Snowden’s leaks added value without doing any harm to US national security, unlike the 2016 WikiLeaks data dumps .\n",
            "[Doc 556]: If Snowden had been a patriotic whistle blower, he would have first found legal avenues for his pursuit in reigning in the NSA. For instance, he could have appealed to members of Congress, who are elected to represent the American people. Instead, he went straight to largely foreign journalists and newspaper editors and burdened them with the responsibility to decide which of the stolen documents should be kept secret and which should reach the public domain. Snowden may have argued that he was acting nobly, but it was actually careless, as journalists and their editors aren’t qualified to decide such legal matters, especially when their interests are about selling newspapers, not protecting U.S. national security.\n",
            "[Doc 1085]: Contrary to Snowden’s claim about wanting to stand up for his fellow Americans, the information he leaked actually created more harm than good . The majority of the information that he shared is about the U.S. spying on foreign nations and not its domestic operations. As such, he risked damaging America’s relationship with foreign countries. By doing so, Snowden not only undermined U.S. alliances around the world but also U.S. efforts to undermine enemies that operate in countries where citizens have less ability to protect themselves from tyranny. If he had been a true patriot interested in protecting the American constitution, as he claims he is, he would have focused on collecting and leaking only the information that documented the NSA’s overreach in domestic spying operations.\n",
            "[Doc 2335]: Past leaders are dead and if they have become heroes it has already been accepted that accounts of that figure may not be entirely accurate as with any myths and legends – and indeed many country’s heroes are myths such as King Arthur. Where they are not as in the case of Atatürk the man is mythologised in order to help show the unity of the nation and provide an example, an ideal if you will, for those who follow. Insulting this hero by deliberately publicising their dark side is therefore damaging not just for the state but for those who believe in the in the role model that the hero provides. In a country like Turkey where the focus of history teaching is on political citizenship education based upon national history everyone in Turkey learns about Atatürk. The aim is to educate pupils “As future citizens who respect the principles and reforms of Atatürk and democracy; who care for their families, country and the nation; who are aware of their responsibilities towards the Republic of Turkey; who work for promoting their families, country and the nation.”  So any attack will be damaging one of the role models for Turks young and old.\n",
            "[Doc 472]: If Snowden genuinely believed in the righteousness of his cause and actions, he would have been confident enough to remain in the United States and face the consequences of stealing and leaking the NSA documents. Instead, he escaped to Hong Kong and then Moscow , where he still resides. His seeking refuge in these two countries suggests that their governments gained highly valuable information and insight regarding NSA operations.\n",

It is a “gateway right”. Possessing a right is only as valuable as your capacity to exercise it. A government cannot claim to protect freedom of speech or expression, and freedom of information, if it is taking away from its citizens the tools to access them. And that is exactly what the disruption of internet service does. Internet access needs to be a protected right so that all other rights which flow from it.

I automatically look for their motive and find ways in which their actions aren't purely evil, and where the situation could have been resolved without killing them or completely wrecking their life's work. In films where 'the hero wins' and 'the villain loses', the morality is entirely bipolar, teaching children that some people are good and some people are evil and we shouldn't question this. This kind of thinking isn't what we need in a situation where it has already caused wars. In original versions of fairy tales, the morality is often quite complex, with main characters performing evil actions, the most unsympathetic people turning out not to be evil and nothing being as it seems. Fairy-tale magic isn't something 'good' or 'bad', its something untrustworthy, a bargain that you don't know the conditions of, with dire consequences if it isn't kept.\n",

He went on to star in six more James Bond movies, cementing how we think of the on-screen character.

            "[Doc 1800]: As noted above, the political life is steeped in difficult decisions, and some of these are bound to result in choices that are at least potentially illegal. The ability to prosecute politicians incentivizes political opponents to search out past actions by said politicians so as to immobilize them politically. Such prosecutions are therefore not motivated by concern for justice, nor are they conducive to a well-functioning, multipartisan political system wherein representatives seek to work together to achieve their political ends. In the most extreme cases, powerful politicians use prosecutions to immobilize their political opponents.\n",
            "[Doc 2699]: Research has also demonstrated a connection between economic inequality and political voice. The political process is far more responsive to the claims of the privileged, and the privileged are far better organized and engaged in the political process than are less affluent citizens. Recent studies show that government officials are far more likely to support the policy preferences of the wealthy than those of the poor. In short, there is considerable evidence to suggest that there is a growing divide between those who have wealth and political influence and those who do not.

            "[Doc 632]: The Western world has made great strides when it comes to feminism , but gender equality shouldn’t be a factor when people’s lives are at risk. A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole. Female soldiers also have higher potential to be targeted for enemy attacks. Enemies don’t care about political correctness, and if letting women serve in combat units poses a threat to the safety of all soldiers, then providing equal opportunity to men and women must come second.\n",
            "[Doc 1816]: Many able, idealistic and talented individuals are discouraged or excluded from participating in the political process by aggressive negative campaigning . Bright potential candidates may be concerned about intrusion by political opponents into their private lives or backgrounds . They may be opposed in principle to participating in a political culture that obliges aspirant office holders to engage in smear- and fear-lead campaigning. Under the status quo, only those able to stomach the confrontational and bullying tactics that have grown up around contemporary electioneering will dare enter the political arena. Moreover, such trends in political culture favour candidates with close links to the media. Individuals able to command the ear of newspaper owners, or who possess a professional background in journalism or publicity will be better able to manipulate or evade attacks launched via television and mass communications. A democratic system is best served when it encourages the participation of candidates from a range of backgrounds and professional fields. The ability of a government to arrive at novel solutions to problems confronting a state, to understand that state’s economy and to effectively represent different sectors of the population will be compromised without a diverse skillset within the state’s legislative and executive branches. By transforming politics into a game based on the production of political “brands” and unassailable, manufactured “personalities,” the jousting and muckraking of negative campaigning gives a disproportionate advantage to former editors and PR men . This dilutes the pool of professionals from which future leaders are drawn, leading to poor policy making (due to a lack of professional skills) and a conservative, sclerotic, defensive approach to political problem solving. Western liberal politics is increasingly discussed only in terms of communication, image, rhetoric and appearance , rather than the technical language of law, economics and diplomacy. Negative campaigning artificially limits the types of people and professions who can engage in political discourse, infantilising and disabling politics itself.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 1799]: It does tremendous damage to the public perception of a given political position to see the holder of that position on trial for criminal acts. Politicians are important role models for the populace at large, and shining light on everyone one of their misdeeds is not conducive to them playing such a role. This hurts the ability of their successors who, though completely innocent, are stepping into an institution now tainted with the image of corruption or scandal. Finally, the very process of prosecution can be damaging to the country, as citizens on opposing sides of the political spectrum disagree over the legitimacy of charges. These effects all deal real damage to the political institutions necessary for the functioning of the state.\n",
            "[Doc 3502]: Politics plays such a large part in how our society is formed. Without an understanding of it young people are more likely to become disengaged or even elect people based solely on personality or media/public opinion, without taking notice of any possible party affiliation, policy/voting records, political and social beliefs or manifesto. Teaching children early on about the working of the political system, it's history and the variety of political beliefs and theories is important if we want to live in society where people are interested and engaged with politics.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 2233]: In Buckley, the Justices declared: “virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.” . This helps to show that nowadays, the effective communication of political ideas cannot be achieved without the expenditure of money. Therefore, one cannot protect political speech and at the same time place restrictions on the main resource which makes it possible, there is little point in freedom to elucidate ideas without the ability to spread those ideas. Spending money has become an inextricable component of political communication.\n",

Politicians dare not confront the damaging effects of imprisonment for fear of being labelled as “soft” on crime. There is greater political cache to be gained from introducing policies that prolong prison terms, and remove judges’ discretion to order non custodial sentences. Novel approaches to the problem of criminality are seen as signs of political weakness. The use of monitored corporal punishment will keep offenders who have not committed serious crimes out of the prison system. At a nominal rate of five lashes for every year of incarceration, flogging will serve as a clear demonstration of societal disapproval, satisfying popular conceptions of retributive “justice”.

But it’s not just America; democracy all over the world seems to be in decline . However, within America, even attacks on the US Capital couldn’t weaken the country’s democratic and Constitutional principles.

            "[Doc 1820]: The trend in developed countries tends to be towards greater centralisation, and concentration of power in the hands of a small number of representatives. This, in turn, leads to the creation of a separate political class who will in some cases be more concerned with their own influence and enrichment than that of the voters, and makes it possible for wealthy individuals or companies to lobby politicians for laws favourable to their interests.

As such, it is hardly surprising that constituents on the far-right and far-left are overwhelmingly educated and even well-off (a trend that held even for the Hezbollah fighters of the 1980s and 90s).

            "[Doc 912]: Social welfare packages provide people with little incentive to work. For example, “ Welfare Queen ” Linda Taylor cheated the system in the ‘70’s and acquired over $150,000 a year from the government – a much higher “salary” than many make in their lifetime. There are less grand examples of others who may not want to permanently live off state handouts , but, like single mother Iris Swift admits, there are “a lot of advantages to staying on welfare.” According to a Cato study, US welfare packages exceed the minimum wage in benefits and salary in every state. If that’s the case, why wouldn’t people take advantage of the system when they get paid more not to work?\n",
            "[Doc 283]: Welfare benefits create a harmful culture of psychological dependence. A study found that welfare recipients are deprived of positive feelings of self-worth after receiving handouts – feelings that are necessary to function in society at full capacity; lack of self-esteem contributes to a lack of motivation and a diminished desire to move up in life. Research from a Yale University study corroborates these findings. Even former President Obama – a staunch advocate for social benefits – cited his own anecdotal evidence of welfare programs encouraging this culture of dependency and reducing motivation in their recipients.\n",
            "[Doc 1205]: Bill Clinton hugely undercut the American welfare system. He reduced the amount of American families that received welfare from 4 million to 1.6 million, and his policies contributed to benefits falling by 32.5% . Clinton believed that a strong economy would lift Americans out of the need for welfare, but he was deeply mistaken. At the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, 8 million people were left with only food stamps as income. Today, there are over 11 million children and teenagers living in deep poverty, partly because of his administration.\n",
            "[Doc 3323]: The problem is that when a country is known for having high taxes, and known for having high levels of welfare, people want to enter the country from other less catered for countries. This means that there will be more people taking from the welfare state who are not willing to work to pay the high taxes. A state cannot be effective economically if there are many people who do not contribute but are more than willing to take.\n",
            "[Doc 1661]: The role of the state is to protect its people and to create the conditions for its people’s prosperity. The Church does not share these objectives. The Church’s objectives are, instead, to either convert as many people as possible to its own religion, and to ‘save souls’ brining people into its own perceived afterlife. The current confusion of state and Church, therefore, is likely to cloud the state’s judgement and limit the state’s ability to provide the maximum possible prosperity and security for its people.\n",
            "[Doc 639]: Aside from adults, social welfare can also brighten the future for poverty-stricken kids, ultimately halting the cycle of poverty in families at risk. A recent study from Georgetown University and University of Chicago found that Mexico’s Prospera – a cash-transfer system conditional on parents sending their children to school and staying up-to-date with doctors’ appointments – led to greater increases in children’s educational attainment long-term. These children grew up to work an average of nine more hours a week than their counterparts who weren’t enrolled in the program, in addition to earning higher hourly wages. Another study found that kids who were covered by Medicaid later earned more money and required less welfare assistance as adults. Poverty can be traumatic for children, and welfare helps the next generation become less reliant on government support.\n",
            "[Doc 843]: Contrary to the argument that welfare disincentivizes people from working, welfare beneficiaries are often those who cannot work. A third of the people who received government assistance in 2015 were off it within the year. In 2018, the number of people registered for food stamps dropped 7 percent year over year, following a 4.5 percent drop in 2017, showing a continued downward trend. Plus, most adults who qualify for TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) for an extended period of time have physical and mental disabilities . Additionally, a large percentage of children in the US receive of one of the six major forms of government assistance, and they participate in these programs longer than do adults.

            "[Doc 1453]: The underlying issue which affirmative action tries to gloss over is the embedded social problems which put the poor and ethnic monitories in continual disadvantages generation after generation. This policy merely papers over the cracks by masking the fact that the failures of state-funded schooling and attempts at integration have led to a situation in which ethnic minorities and the poor are so vastly underrepresented in universities. The state should do more to address these underlying problems, rather than covering up its failures with a tokenistic policy. Better funding of state schools, real parental choice in education, and accountability through the publication of comparable examination data would all drive up standards and allow more underprivileged children to fulfil their potential.\n",
            "[Doc 2959]: Critics claim that background checking could be a violation of human rights. Human rights weigh up the rights of the individual against the overall welfare of society. If this is the case, surely the overall welfare of society would win – particularly if someone has nothing to hide, then they will not mind their past history becoming public knowledge. The only ones who would not allow their backgrounds to be checked out are the ones with something to hide.\n",
            "[Doc 1919]: Neo-functionalism is an example of a liberal theory of regional integration. Its focus is on human welfare needs, not political conflict and law. Its focus is on individuals aggregated into interest groups as the main actors in integration,  so the focus is on low politics and the areas which become integrated in the European Union reflect that. As such there has been much more progress on economic integration than there has on creating a common foreign and security policy.\n",
            "[Doc 1655]: Religions through the ages, and still today, have been agents of repression, sexism, elitism, homophobia, and - most of all - conflict, war, and racial hatred. The very nature of belief in received wisdom means that it must be, at its core, a conservative and regressive force. Moreover the positive moral rules that religions claim to promote tend to have existed independently of those religions – the world did not have to wait for the ten commandments to learn that murder and theft was wrong, but it waited until the 19th Century to reach a consensus that Slavery was wrong. Whatever small amount of psychological comfort religious belief may give, the evils it is responsible for in the social and political worlds easily outweigh it.\n",

            "[Doc 1390]: There is an old saying ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’. In order for this proposal to be taken into consideration, a problem regarding the world of sports must be identified. Fortunately for sports, it works like a charm. In a great many sports revenues are going up, television rights are being sold for higher prices than ever before and more and more children are enrolling in sporting activities. Despite the global economic slowdown, sports revenues worldwide should grow by about 3.7 percent to $145.3 billion by 2015, according to a research report. Moreover, if we were to introduce this coercive measure, there would be numerous disadvantages without significant benefits. It would make no sense to create purposeless tensions between individuals and sporting federations. It is even more absurd considering that competitions and sporting events wouldn't benefit at all. This is because almost all top sportspeople accept the request to represent their country, and indeed see it as an honour and privilege. Therefore, it would create no advantages regarding the level of the game or increase the spectacle.\n",
            "[Doc 1078]: Many people who are opposed to paid maternity leave argue that it will cause an unfair hike in payroll taxes to cover the extra government payouts. But consider the welfare costs of not taking maternity leave. Many parents can’t afford to live on one income, even for just a few weeks. They slip into credit card debt and might be forced to turn to food stamps and other welfare payments. A report from the United States Department of Labor discovered that approximately 15% of people who took unpaid or partly-paid leave turned to welfare payments. A Rutgers University study in New Jersey, where there is state-mandated paid maternity leave, found that women who took paid leave were 40% less likely to take public assistance or food stamps than women who didn’t take leave.\n",
            "[Doc 3335]: Most social welfare programs are paternalistically administrated by an army of public servants. Most programs have strict eligibility requirements and rules on spending welfare money - to ensure that public dollars are not wasted. Every dollar of benefit has to be accounted for to ensure that they are wisely spent on individuals' needs, rather than more sinister ways. While this is a noble objective, greater accountability requirements demand greater administrative resources. More social workers need to be hired to look over the shoulder of benefactors; more administrators are needed to ensure eligibility requirements are met; and more administrators are needed to administer the additional public servants. This adds layers after layers of bureaucracy and layers after layers of costs. In some countries, 40 per cent of government spending is on the wages and salaries of public servants. A negative income tax system would eliminate the unnecessary administrative burden, allowing governments to spend additional money on welfare or on other priorities. While this would inevitably invite corrupt spending of taxpayers money, certain studies have said that the benefit (greater resources from the eliminated bureaucracy to be reprioritized) outweighs the cost (the money that is unwisely wasted by certain individuals on, for example, drugs and alcohol).\n",
            "[Doc 1237]: The advantage of the current system is its universality, it does not require any interpretation of who is and is not included. Who exactly is a celebrity? How do you define that and how do you insure that it isn’t used to cover the children of law makers and other influential individuals? Celebrity, almost by its nature, is impossible to define and the moment you attempt to do so – ‘all professional singers’ for example – you create a loophole that people will rush through.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 874]: A strong democracy should not allow for partisan abuses of election rules, yet gerrymandering does just that. A recent study suggests that the practice has increasingly affected election cycle’s results, culminating in 16-17 seats in the current Congress that are thanks to gerrymandering alone. Gerrymandered districts allow for elected officials to choose their constituents , rather than giving voters the basic right to appoint their own representatives. If America is to call itself a true democracy, then the vote needs to be brought back to the citizens. Gerrymandering warrants the same kind of checks and balances that have been established to keep America’s government from veering from democracy in the first place.\n",
            "[Doc 678]: Gerrymandering gets a bad rap due to the increasing amount of extremist members in Congress. This is because people automatically think that the shifting or redrawing of Congressional boundaries create a homogeneous district that will lead to blowouts for one party or the other. However, gerrymandering is not the culprit: geographical self-sorting is. A study examining America’s partisan divide found growing evidence of polarity among citizens across counties, states and regions. For example, there was an 8% increase in polarization between 2008 and 2012, irrespective of redistricting changes. In other words, Americans themselves are becoming more extreme in their political views, and are, therefore, voting in more extreme candidates. Diversity within each party is sharply narrowing; the Pew Research Center identified a widening gap between Democrats and Republicans on a number of values, up by 21% from 1994. Gerrymandering may highlight America’s growing polarization and thus, its lack of an ideological middle, but it is certainly not the cause.\n",
            "[Doc 365]: Opponents of gerrymandering often cite the practice as the reason there is a lack of competition in the political system. Yet, there is another factor that plays a much bigger role: Us. Bill Bishop recognized the phenomena of Americans self-segregating into politically like-minded communities, coining the term “The Big Sort. ” This describes how Democrats tend to move into cities , while Republicans gravitate more towards rural communities, making it more difficult to draw competitive districts. Whether or not this is a favorable practice, studies show that voters are actually physically sorting themselves; in other words, we are doing the partisan gerrymandering on our own, before political parties even have to.\n",
            "[Doc 847]: There is a reason that the Supreme Court avoids tackling cases of partisan gerrymandering; it aids both Republicans and Democrats, and preserves order in our government. Both parties have access to technology that allows them to reorganize districts in a way which gives themselves a competitive advantage, leading neither party towards political setback. Additionally, fewer competitive races is beneficial for everyone , as it means less need for staff and fundraising. A number of analyses show that anyone can take more seats in the House when they gerrymander; the point of democracy is that people elect other people to represent and promote their causes in any legitimate way possible. Gerrymandering is legitimate, and if everyone can use it equally – so, why not?\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 260]: Redistricting often misrepresents the political leanings of the people living in the districts being reorganized. Take swing-state North Carolina, which narrowly leaned in favor of Donald Trump as president while electing a Democratic governor in 2016. North Carolina is a “purple” state (i.e., a state with a nearly equal amount of Republican and Democrat voters), yet its congressional delegation allots ten House seats to Republicans and only three to Democrats. For the first time in history, a federal court wet its feet in the gerrymandering issue and ruled the state’s redistricting plan unconstitutional, in that it unduly favored one party over another. As long as redistricting continues to disproportionately favor one party, a large percentage of voters won’t have their political interests appropriately represented.\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 2937]: Even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity. There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 1806]: Unrest in Northern Ireland was started by the appalling treatment of the Catholic minority there. When there was a Northern Ireland Parliament there was some gerrymandering, while the discrimination in representation was slight very few nationalists were able to get senior jobs, in the civil service for example in 1927 fourteen of the 229 officers of staff officer rank or above, or 6 per cent, were Catholic, while in 1959 there were forty-six Catholics out of 740 in such ranks, or once again, 6 per cent. The best way to ensure equal treatment of the Catholics in Ireland is to unite majority Protestant Northern Ireland with Catholic majority Republic of Ireland, where they will be better represented in politics and not stigmatized by their neighbors.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1369]: The argument that internet news tends to offer small passages of text compared to newspapers is to be liberal with the truth, due to the vast nature of the internet it offers a variety of styles and is arguably more likely to provide longer passages than newspapers as there is not space restriction as there is with newspapers which can only be a certain size, due to advertisements and printing agreements. With the ability to both search for and easily share content via social networks, the argument that newspapers are better as they prevent information overload feels weak because there are many ways in which content can be filtered to ensure that both the news you actually want and the style and perspective you prefer can be easily accessed.\n",
            "[Doc 4062]: Schools are communities that not only emphasize collective learning but also encourage sports and creativity in the form of extra curricular activities; such activities serve as a utility to instill societal values into the next generation. These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",
            "[Doc 350]: Conservatives have long disagreed with the mainstream media’s liberal tilt . But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted. Not only does this stop conservatives from challenging their own perspective , it also limits their ability to persuade and engage others. For instance, while the majority of Americans were taking efforts to ward off exposure to the coronavirus, a small minority ( 12% ), many of whom reportedly watched Fox News, weren’t concerned, mirroring the station’s initial lackadaisical coverage of the pandemic. Having an additional viewpoint is positive but creating a bubble (a phenomenon present on both sides of the partisan divide) is not.\n",
            "[Doc 276]: In the last few years, vast reserves of resources like oil and gas have suddenly been made available due to the creation of cost-effective extraction techniques, like fracking, which are completely transforming the US’s perspective on energy. Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006. This significantly reduced the price of gas and created a huge boom in domestic oil production.\n",
            "[Doc 1550]: One can conceive of an infinite amount of cases in which results of a think tank’s research are completely independent of their funders. Their opposition, however, will be likely to signal corruption, when in fact there may be no relation between a funder and certain results. Even if they are associated by sharing a perspective or an aim, this is not a sign of corruption or bias, and it should not enter into the value of a think tank. There has been one study of charity donations (as think tanks are) that concludes that anonymous donations are “a costly signal of a charity’s quality by an informed donor”.\n",

When Americans use drones for targeting killings, other countries are likely to follow her lead. For example, China has weighed using drone strikes in Myanmar to deter illegal drug trade. With the definition of terrorist groups highly dependent on the goals of each individual government, it’s easy to imagine how drone warfare could devolve into a free-for-all. Another example: the use and availability of drones are increasing casualties and intensities of regional clashes in areas like Armenia and Azerbaijan that, until now, have been limited by such countries’ inability to wage air campaigns. On a larger scale, a 2022 deadly drone attack in the middle of Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels may mean an escalation of violence in an already volatile region. And let’s not forget about Syria, where the US and Russia are supporting opposing sides.

It’s not the UN’s fault that international human rights are trampled on, but the organization seems powerless to stop it. Take the genocide in Rwanda , where the UN had an “Assistance Mission” established in 1994. Its members were aware of the impending genocide, but UN peacekeepers failed to stop the majority Hutus from murdering almost a million minority Tutsis. Another example is the 2005 rape and sexual abuse against Congolese children, perpetuated by UN peacekeepers themselves. Subsequent reports found similar allegations in other countries. Most recently, the UN and its UN Women organization have been called out for ignoring and/or denying Hamas members’ brutal and systemic rape of Israeli women on Oct. 7, 2023. If the UN doesn’t speak out against such human rights violations, what’s its purpose for existing?\n",

Take peacekeepers fathering and abandoning babies : There is no exact number of abandoned children known, (a dozen paternity claims were received in 2014), but the phenomenon motivated the United Nations to initiate a DNA collection protocol. Also, the world’s most recent outbreak of cholera in 2010, after an earthquake rocked Haiti, points to the UN. Genome testing demonstrated that the source of the plague, which infected over one million people and killed 10,000, was most likely a Nepali UN peacekeeping force. A UN- appointed panel of experts found that the cholera strain diagnosed in Haiti was “a perfect match” for a strain found in Nepal. Nepalese peacekeepers were staying at the UN camp in Haiti during the earthquake, and poor sanitation flooded local waterways with sewage from the camp. Such unintended consequences show that the UN has done more harm than good in parts of the world it has tried to help.\n",

However doing this will not, in the global reality we live in, “redistribute a portion of the wealth gained in mining and resource extraction” in a fair, sustainable and reliable way that directly adds value to the lives of a nation’s people . Also, the Prop propose that introducing such high taxes will reduce the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor. However, in reality, such tax would only further push the poor into poverty and increase the wealth of the rich as the mismanagement of funds cannot be guaranteed by many nontransparent nations in the world . This is counterproductive to the purpose that the proposition wish to achieve through the implementation of this tax. One of the major issues that we as the opposition have been continuously reinforcing is the trust involved in implementing such tax. It is clear that many resource rich nations have a lack of transparency in their governments’ desicions . By giving them access to such tax funds we cannot be sure that they will use it to directly help their people. Instead it is more likely that they will be using this tax to further line their pockets as corrupt nations make up well over half of the world’s countries We cannot give such a huge responsibility to societies where corruption occurs every day, rather we need to place pressure on companies to act responsibly.\n",

When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

Becoming a UN Goodwill Ambassador means going through a vetting system that requires having a sizeable number of followers as well as producing the right kind of image.

In Syria, for example, Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father, Hafez, who ruled from 1971 to 2000, while Mubarak, Saleh and Gaddafi were believed to be grooming their sons as successors. The term jumlukiya , a combination of the Arabic words for republic and monarchy, had even been coined to describe the state of Arab rule. This concept was forcibly rejected by the Arab people. Not only have these rulers been tossed out, but the message has been sent of the power residing in the population. Whether something better replaces them remains to be seen.\n",

The only alternative future for the North is of a failed state going economically and socially in the opposite direction from the rest of Eastern Asia but now armed with nuclear weapons. The security threat this poses to the region is terrifying. However, it seems unlikely that the regime has any intention of surrendering their absolute power and the people are unlikely to remove him however bad things get, North Koreans do not have access to the tools such as mobile phones and the internet that made the Arab Spring possible. As well as the security implications there is a simple issue of morality, in any other situation where the actions of a government were impoverishing a people to, quite literally, the point of starvation, the world would feel moved to act. It is as clearly in the interests of North Koreans not to starve to death by the hundreds of thousands as it is in the interests of the South not to see similar numbers irradiated by a bomb on Seoul.\n",

In the 2014 legislative elections, Ennahda finished second to the secularist Nidaa Tounes party (Ennahda had stepped down the previous September following a deal with the opposition). In the first direct presidential election, held in November 2014, Beji Caid Essebsi won power. The post-revolutionary period in Tunisia has not been without its challenges, including the political crisis that forced Ennahda from power.

            "[Doc 2803]: In situations where you go to spend your whole day of work, you should be able to feel comfortable. Sometimes, saying the wrong thing could be harrasment. Depending on the situation, if an employee doesn't appreciate what another employee says to them that seems offending and makes them uncomfortable then that basically could mean harrasment. In companys today, a lot of people lose their jobs from saying the wrong things, which is a lot of times related to sexual harrasment. When your work place becomes a place where you don't feel safe or want to go to anymore dealing with harrasments and all then yes it is okay for people to lose their jobs from saying the wrong things that could lead an employee to feeling uncomfortable. Just like saying offending things about someone's race is just as bad as harrassing someone at work. I know of people that lose their jobs from saying and doing the wrong things at work. Sometimes, one employee could not appreciate what you say but the other employee keeps saying it, that could get you in big trouble especially if you know that the person doesn't appreciate it. If an employee is married, and a co-worker has a crush on that employee and tries to get involved with her by saying things that could imply to her that he is trying and already knows that she is married and doesn't appreciate it then that is harrasment. If these kinds of things happen and no one corrects the employee that was doing and saying all the wrong things then that would just give the company a bad name and it would also cause the workers to not want to work at a company like that. All employees want to work at a place where they feel safe and comfortable. Also, employees like jobs that actually show that they care about them. That when they get into situations like sexual harrasment and all that the company will do anything in their power to help them feel safe. So i believe that when situations like sexual harrasment is involved or major things dealing with racial and negative things that offend people and could make a company's reputation go bad then yes people should lose their jobs for saying and doing the wrong things.\n",

            "[Doc 2802]: Yes, i believe that people should be accountable for what they say or do if it's inappropriate. It is very unprofessional and it would cause a bad name for the company. As a professional employee we tend to forget that when we are employed we not only represent ourselves but we also represent the company and the employer. Also, professional employees need to remember that being professional means that in any situation it is not appropriate to say anything that would offend other employees or customers. Sometimes, employees take their personal lives to work and it sometimes cause problems to arise. There are employees who try to find other co-workers to confide in and it ends up leaking out to other co-workers and rumors spread and then problems occur. These are sometimes what causes people to say things that are wrong or shouldn't be said at all. Being humans, we tend to say things without thinking about it. Sometimes we think we are helping with the problem but we just end up making it worse. For example, from personal experience, Sam's Club is a really great place to work. You learn a lot from working there, at least i did from working in the jewelry department. But the big problem over there is people tend to get in trouble by saying things that are wrong. Like, spreading rumors about people or just saying something offending to a co-worker gets you in trouble. Especially if it deals with that persons race, religion, and anything that could offend that person. One of my co-workers was jokingly talking about the stereotypes of another country not knowing that the co-worker in the same room was from there and it offended her. The guy that made the joke got written up and got a warning. I honestly believe that it is wrong to say things that could be offending because everyone has feelings and if it's too the extreme of making someone not wanting to come back to work or something that would make the company's reputation bad then yes i believe that people should lose their jobs for it.\n",

For example, it has always been the case that men have been the providers, the defenders of themselves, the household and the family. Women have been the maintainers of these things. These things are not unfair. They are simply what each gender is best suited for. Women should not feel lesser than men simply because they are \"supposed\" to do \"motherly things\".

Israel also promotes freedom of religion , as its Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters in Jerusalem, whose residents also live side by side, prove. Citizens and visitors are allowed to pray and practice their religion freely. Another key argument against labeling Israel as an apartheid state is its democratic structure and commitment to democratic principles. Arab Israeli citizens , who compose 21% of the Israeli population, can and have served in Israel’s parliament and other positions in government, including diplomatic roles and as judges in the country’s courts, including on the Supreme Court . They are entitled to the same municipal and educational services and have the same municipal voting rights as Jewish Israelis.

It will provide an opportunity for paedophile networks to expand, by allowing them to target even younger children – now lawfully. The problem of paedophilia is already a rapidly growing one, made worse by its expansion into ‘related’ avenues such as child pornography. In addition to the obvious problem of paedophilia, the problem of the sexual predation of young children also encompasses the problem of youth prostitution (since prostitution is itself already legal in many countries), and the international traffic in boys and girls.\n",

But the democratic experiment did not last long. In July 2013, Morsi was ousted in a military coup by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. While some pointed to autocratic tendencies in Morsi himself, Sisi has overseen a level of oppression exceeding that of the Mubarak era.

            "[Doc 2099]: Governments have accepted, in documents like the universal declaration of human rights, that one of their primary roles is to provide a basic standard of living for their citizens. When the state simply hands out some money this responsibility is not fulfilled. The state is simply leaving the poor to fend for themselves with a little extra money. Governments provide subsidies in kind or for specific products and services for a reason; those are the things that are necessities rather than luxuries. If money is transferred directly then the person who is getting the money can use the government’s money on anything. Some may use it on the things the government was providing before but others will spend the money badly on tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Subsidies however can be targeted at the things that the poor really need. This means the state provides subsidies for food, free or cheap housing and healthcare, fuel for cooking and heating etc.\n",
            "[Doc 1641]: In Western liberal democracies, we generally consider an individual’s private sphere to be worth protecting. We only give the state license to violate it when something is objectively largely harmful to that person or to society. When something is not very clearly harmful we let people make their own decisions because the state is not infallible in its judgements about what lifestyles are better than others. Therefore, simply saying that there is a risk that printers will be misused is not sufficient grounds for banning them altogether. If technology makes it easier for people to do what they want, this is a good thing; if people then want to do things that we consider harmful this is a problem in itself. The solution is not to ban an entire means of production in order to stop a minority from producing dangerous things, but to educate people about the risks so they can freely make better decisions. Making it harder for people to do bad things is useless, furthermore, since those that wish to purchase a gun or take drugs can already find ways of doing so without 3D printers. One may even argue that it is better for everybody to have access to a gun, for example, and not only those who are willing to break the law to get one.\n",
            "[Doc 3660]: In boom or recession, one of the worst things a government can do is encourage its citizens NOT to spend. It is the flow of cash that keeps the economy alive, increasing liquidity and preventing the need for cash injections which spell inflation. If taxation became focused purely on spending, as soon as things looked bleak spending would grind to a halt, and the economy could easily collapse. The last thing we need is a disincentive to spend - especially with a recession likely to be on its way. The opposing argument fundamentally misunderstands the point being made here. It claims that 'the writer is (correctly) pointing out that, all other things being equal, the greater the income tax, the less consumers spend'. In fact, the point that has been made in this column is that indirect taxation would discourage spending to a greater degree than income tax\n",
            "[Doc 3491]: Tennis and cricket are allot faster sports which are allot harder to judge. For instance in tennis there is mainly just the one question. Did the ball cross the line or not. In football there are two. Did it cross the line and Did it cross the line by fair means or foul. It would be unfair to answer just one of of those questions with technology but to leave the other unanswered. To answer both questions you would have to video everything that went on before the goal which would not be enjoyable. Limited challenges are also unfair because if, after judicial use of your allowances, you spot horrendous foul, your stuck. A serious question is: Why does Football, without all this technology have far far more viewers that all these other sports that use it.\n",

March 21, 2019 | A.Kadir Yildirim, Meredith McCain. In a recent survey in 10 Arab nations (Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian Territories),1 we measured public attitudes toward the Arab Spring protests, its goals, and its beneficiaries. In our survey, respondents were asked to rank the goals of the Arab Spring protests from a list that includes increasing political freedoms, reducing corruption, enhancing dignity, improving the economic situation, and promoting social justice, among others. On average, fewer than 20 percent of respondents agreed that the goals of economic improvement and social justice were reached, despite ranking these as the top two goals of the Arab Spring protests. Survey respondents’ views on how various ethno-religious groups benefited from or were harmed by the Arab Spring process reveal notable signs of the way these groups are perceived by the society at large (Figure 8).\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 483]: Under Reagan’s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, the country had suffered from years of stagflation , i.e., inflation without economic growth. When Reagan took office, he brought a new economic approach, lowering taxes and lifting burdensome regulations. While it took a couple years to get going, Reagan’s economy was a model of strength. From 1983 to 1988, annual GDP growth never dipped below 3.5 percent (for context, the last time the US hit that mark was 2005 – before surging to 5.9 percent in 2021). In 1984, growth reached a whopping 7.3 percent, the highest mark since 1951. Unemployment fell from over 10 percent in 1983 to just above 5 percent when Reagan’s term ended. While Reagan did run a deficit, the severity is often exaggerated. Barack Obama and George W. Bush added more to the debt in 2009 alone than Reagan did in eight years in office.\n",
            "[Doc 359]: Reagan is often credited with reviving the US economy, though his first term began with a 16-month recession. His true legacy, though, is one of expanding deficits caused by a growing defense budget and tax cuts that proved to be irresponsible. During Reagan’s presidency, there were also a record eight government shutdowns , suggesting enduring political partisanship and battles. When it came to responsible budgeting, Reagan was anything but a fiscal conservative. The budget deficit was just $79 billion Reagan’s first year in office, around 1.5 percent of GDP. By 1983, the shortfall had reached $208 billion , or 5.6 percent of GDP. It would reach $221 billion in 1986. The national debt nearly tripled to more than $2.6 billion when he left office. Had the US gone deeply into the red improving health care (these were the years of the AIDS crisis , which Reagan was infamously indifferent about) or fighting poverty , it may have been justifiable. But this was decidedly not the case.\n",
            "[Doc 315]: While the Berlin Wall fell during George H.W. Bush’s first year in office, it was President Reagan’s strong foreign policy and tough stance towards the Soviet Union that helped the US win the Cold War. Upon taking office, Reagan launched a military buildup aimed at reassuring the country’s allies , forcing the USSR to the negotiating table, and ensuring that the US could prevail in the event of war. Defense spending rose from 5.5 percent of GDP in 1979 to 6.8 percent in 1986. Reagan also recommitted the US to stopping the spread of Soviet-style Marxism around the globe . In Afghanistan, he upped his predecessor’s support for anti-Soviet forces, leading the USSR to flee. At the same time, he was restrained in the use of military force. While many of Reagan’s actions – including his Strategic Defense Initiative, a missile defense system dubbed “Star Wars” by critics – were mocked at the time, Reagan had the last laugh. His commitment to “peace through strength” was vindicated with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n",
            "[Doc 280]: While the collapse of the Soviet Union coincided with Reagan’s term in office, it was caused not by Reagan’s military buildup, tough talk or “ Star Wars ” speech. The fundamental weakness of the Soviet economy and Mikhail Gorbachev’s leadership played a much greater role – Reagan was simply in office at the right time. Reagan’s actual foreign policy decisions brought about undesirable consequences. His military buildup led to huge deficits. His support for Nicaraguan Contras undermined that country’s democracy and stability (and led to the Iran-Contra scandal, detailed below). His intervention in Afghanistan helped pave the way for the Taliban and al Qaeda. And his invasion of the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, which included a mistaken bombing of a mental hospital , irked even US allies .\n",
            "[Doc 1009]: It may be hard to imagine former president Trump and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or current President Biden and current House Speaker Kevin McCarthy kicking off their shoes after work and knocking back a glass of whiskey together, but that is exactly how Reagan and House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Democrat, ended their day. And his aisle-crossing was not limited to happy hour. His immigration reform bill signed in 1986 allowed amnesty for those who entered the country before 1982. He also worked with O’Neill on a deficit reduction bill that increased taxes . Some of these actions were not popular among Reagan’s base, but they won over the electorate at large. Reagan won both his elections by a landslide, and in his re-election came with the most electoral votes in history. And Americans’ view of the Gipper has only improved with time. He also won over people’s hearts and appreciation by publicly sharing his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in 1994.\n",
            "[Doc 201]: Few episodes have represented a betrayal of the American trust to the degree of the Iran-Contra affair . In an attempt to free American hostages held by Lebanese terrorists and to support Nicaraguan Contras, Reagan’s administration covertly sold weapons to Iran and funneled the proceeds to the Latin American rebels. The former was both illegal – there was an embargo against shipping arms to Iran – and a violation of his campaign pledge not to negotiate with terrorists. The latter violated a Congressional ban against operations in Nicaragua. The operation was a failure; while three hostages were released, three more were soon abducted. When the operation came to light, it badly damaged Reagan’s reputation and led to charges against 14 people in the administration, including Oliver North .\n",

Additionally, take currency: Part of America’s rise to power was due to the post-WWII Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, in which delegates from around the world agreed that exchange rates would be rooted in gold, with the US dollar being the reserve currency. This rendered the dollar the most important currency in the world, and as a result, the US became the world’s foundation for economic stability. China, however, doesn’t have the trust that the world showed the US after WWII; the country’s persistent adherence away from Western ideals will keep the world at large from getting too close.\n",

            "[Doc 432]: Let’s take a look at tax rates over time. A tax reform bill that became law in 2018 set new tax rates for Americans, lowering rates for most brackets, including the wealthy, by 1-4 percent. In fact, these tax cuts helped billionaires pay less taxes than the working class. In 2015, that year’s top tax rate was less than half the 91 percent it was under President Eisenhower , a Republican. The top rate was consistently 70 percent or higher until the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s, and those cuts resulted in the national debt tripling in eight years.\n",
            "[Doc 762]: Being deemed the greatest should solely be about Ali’s boxing abilities. However, people confuse those with his out-of-the-ring deeds. Ali changed the world . He was a freedom fighter who fought against racism . He also had unparalleled charisma and charm. He was a master of self-promotion and smart enough to know how to use the media for his purposes. This made him loved by fans and the media for his brave and picturesque figure. All of this created a mythical figure. Ali`s image was one of an undisputed champion, a person larger than life. However, that doesn’t mean he was the greatest boxer. He himself once noted that, pound for pound, Sugar Ray Robinson was better.\n",

The President of the RoC visited São Tomé in January 2014,  he was last intending to visit only two years before but cancelled as President Manuel Pinto da Costa was overseas. As one of the poorest countries in the world without the question of recognition the PRC would have practically no interest in such a small African state.\n",
            "[Doc 1000]: Having a conservative voice among the news channels to question assumed wisdom and counter perceived bias makes sense in theory. But at Fox News, winning over conservative viewers has sometimes led the network to promote baseless conspiracy theories. These include the Fox Chariman Rupert Murdoch and several commentators’ privately rejecting election conspiracy theories even while promoting them online, since-retracted claims calling the coronavirus a Democratic-backed impeachment scam , and bogus accusations that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya . Perhaps more damaging is the reflexive partisanship, which in recent years manifested itself in a constant criticism of Obama and seemingly uncritical defense of former President Trump. Plus, the former president’s hiring in the summer of 2018 of former Fox executive Bill Shine to head White House communications strengthened the perception that the network and Republican party were closely linked. ( Shine subsequently left the post in March 2019 to reportedly join Trump’s failed re-election campaign . Let’s also take note that it was Fox News’ Tucker Carlson who reportedly convinced President Trump not to go to war with Iran in June 2019.\n",
            "[Doc 676]: From an Electoral College system that allowed him to become president without winning the popular vote to a tax system that offers the wealthy too many loopholes , Trump has highlighted many flaws in the way that things are run in the US. By creating a stir over these issues, Trump may have helped American liberals in the long term. Also, ever since Trump became US president, there has been a rise in hate crimes against minorities across America. This includes a rise in anti-Semitism . The discourse since the 2016 US election has revealed the prejudice that still exists in “liberal” America. Trump brought a large population that adopts a racist agenda out of the woodwork, likely due to his anti-immigration rhetoric . The reasons behind this hatred and vitriol now must – and can – be addressed for the US to grow as a nation. The same way disillusioned middle-America rallied in protest of Obama and ended up with Trump, liberals now have a platform on which to stand in order to fight for a president that combats the flaws that Trump has brought to light.\n",
            "[Doc 1131]: Barack Obama’s presidency witnessed significant strides toward a more multicultural America that celebrates diversity. Top policy positions went to people of all colors, classes and creeds. Obama appointed more female and ethnically diverse judges than any president in history, including the Supreme Court’s first Latina Judge. He was the first president to introduce Hindu customs into the White House, or to wish Persian Americans a happy new year in Farsi. He also strengthened LGTB rights , paving the way for marriage equality and anti-discrimination legislation. No president better reflected America’s diversity, or honored it so single-mindedly as he.\n",
            "[Doc 1953]: A person is most likely to survive when they have an accident, a heart attack, or some other condition if they get prompt treatment and doctors are aware of any underlying conditions. Mills may well have lived, or lived longer if there had been more transparency about his death. There had been no prior warning that the president might be rushed to hospital despite the doctors having been called in the previous day. For the same reason his outriders were not available leading to indecision over whether to send off the ambulance. And finally he was initially turned away from the emergency ward because they did not know it was the President they were being asked to treat.\n",
            "[Doc 466]: Clinton created more jobs than any president in US history. In 1992, the year before he took office, unemployment was at 7.5%. His policies reduced it to 4% by the time he left the White House. Over his eight years as president, 23.2 million jobs were created, at an average of 242,000 per month. Wages increased, the rate of homeownership reached a historic high of 67.7%, and the poverty rate fell to 11.8%. Also, between 1993 and 1999, the real median family income went up by around $6,000.\n",
            "[Doc 1964]: Whilst President Afewerki was fighting for Eritrean independence he became a proponent of the self-reliant state, which could sustain its own population with no external assistance. Since independence the President has rejected foreign aid to the country through claims that aid is a method of enslavement to international donors1. Numerous offers of assistance, including the free food distributions of the World Food Programme, have been rejected in favour of the domestic market2. Afewerki claims that as aid decreases, farmers will work harder to ensure that food demand is met. The lack of donors and trading partners has served to weaken Eritrea’s ties of the outside world, making the state responsible for its own isolation.\n",
            "[Doc 1080]: It doesn’t matter if you’re erecting a billboard or sending a mass newsletter. There is always one person at the other end of a marketing message. This person is a human being, and, as such, s/he is led by evolution, circumstance, mood, culture and subconscious to an equal or greater degree than logic. The basic idea here is that you can’t use a rational tool to illicit action from an emotional and unpredictable being. (Ever tried to logically persuade someone from the opposite political agenda about your point of view? Did it work?) Our attachment to our views despite evidence to the contrary is well documented . This innate human “failure” also comes into play in the way we understand data. Big data means that there are enough facts to support more than one claim. We can more easily identify and demonstrate patterns we are partial to, or as the renowned economist Ronald H. Cause once said: “If you torture the data long enough, it will tell you anything.”\n",

But with active presidents, Reagan among them, the verdict of history is likely to be many years in the coming. On all the major social issues-abortion, quotas, gay rights, feminism, crime and punishment, the family, moral and religious values-the Reagan administration has been conservative and correct, even if reasonable people might quarrel over details of policy and political strategy.

            "[138/185] Summarizing: Should Puerto Rico become the 51st state?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 575]: Puerto Rico should not be the 51st U.S. state but, rather, a fully independent country. As already discussed, because Puerto Rico is a U.S. colony, it is dependent on and constrained by U.S. federal regulations and laws. Transitioning into independence would let Puerto Rico address its debt crisis on its own terms and grant its inhabitants the right to self-determination. Doing so would give more power to the people, as they would be able to hold accountable elected representatives at all levels of government. This constant state of limbo is eroding Puerto Rico’s ability to stand on its own feet, as many other nations have successfully done.\n",
            "[Doc 1153]: The United States does not impose any federal income tax on U.S. citizens who are residents of the island and profit from Puerto Rican sources. Adding Puerto Rico to the U.S. state register would require these citizens residing and working in Puerto Rico to pay federal income taxes, significantly boosting the Federal Reserve’s annual revenues. This would also mean that American companies would no longer be able to move their businesses offshore to Puerto Rico to evade taxes , a current and significant problem in the U.S. Making Puerto Rico a state would limit accessible corporate corruption channels significantly. It might also make it easier to oversee and/or control how U.S. government funds are actually being utilized there and could prevent local government corruption.\n",
            "[Doc 938]: The Commonwealth filed for bankruptcy in May 2017 and was in an extended process of reaching a deal with creditors . However, in 2022, they officially exited bankruptcy following the largest public debt restructuring in US history. Since Puerto Rico is not currently a U.S. state, it was unable to access Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code , when it fell on financial hardship. What’s more, even if Puerto Rico could access these rights, at that time, he island’s $49 billion of unfunded pension liabilities and $74 billion debt, held by the territory’s government as well as by local public corporations, was so great that they could only cover one-third of the accrued debt. If granted statehood, the U.S. would have inherited this debt. The question is, can the U.S. cope with the challenges that making Puerto Rico a state would impose, or would America (and its national treasury) drown in the process? The aftermath of Hurricane Maria brings up another serious aspect to consider. If Puerto Rico becomes a U.S. state, it would require a lot of money and resources from FEMA every time a natural disaster occurs. Due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Florence, FEMA is already stretched too thin, and several communities within the U.S. are still awaiting assistance. Adding Puerto Rico to the mix would cause much-needed federal funding to be directed away from other U.S. states, at a time where natural disasters are on the rise in America.\n",
            "[Doc 1161]: If, according to American history, “all men are equal in the eyes of the law,” then why don’t Puerto Ricans have equal say in the laws they must uphold? The U.S. currently controls Puerto Rico’s external affairs and federal regulations, yet Puerto Ricans are ineligible to vote in the U.S. presidential elections and have only one non-voting representative in the House. With more than three million citizens living in Puerto Rico, U.S. statehood would enable Puerto Ricans to be represented by two Senators. They would also be allowed to vote in U.S. federal elections and on issues, bills and reforms that affect them.\n",
            "[Doc 338]: The current situation is holding Puerto Ricans back. As of 2023, Puerto Rico’s unemployment rate rested at almost 6%. Before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, it was estimated that roughly 46% of Puerto Ricans were living below the poverty line; Fast forward to 2021 when 56% of children still lived a level below the poverty line. Those leaving (mostly for mainland U.S.) over the past decade are in search of better employment opportunities . In becoming a U.S. state, Puerto Ricans could enjoy both the benefits associated with statehood and the tools needed to develop their own industry and workforce on the island. Statehood would increase local job opportunities , bring about income creation benefits and enable locals to receive better health care, which they are already paying for, but do not currently benefit from. What’s more, with Puerto Ricans enjoying statehood benefits from the comfort of their own homes, they would be able to pursue – and live – the American Dream in their own country.\n",
            "[Doc 1185]: Despite the pro-statehood vote in the November 2020 referendum, Puerto Ricans have to wait indefinitely for Congress to actually do anything about it. The fact that the Puerto Rico Status Act was reintroduced in April 2023 was a good sign, but bureaucracy and bipartisan politics have stalled progress. Meanwhile, many citizens are concerned about their rights and independence as a U.S. state. They do not want to lose their unique cultural heritage and Spanish language, with more in common with Latin America than the U.S. Puerto Ricans are also concerned that they will lose their international standings, including their recognition as an individual Olympic team or participant in world pageants and competitions if they become a U.S. state.\n",
            "[Doc 1705]: The state places rules upon its citizens for the overall betterment of society. However, whenever possible the state also affords citizens liberty. This is the case because the state sees that when people are free to do what they want they are able to make better decisions for themselves and further are able to interact with the state better. They do this because they feel that the state is allowing them to make their own decisions and as such the state is showing its trust in its citizens. This bond of trust between the state and the citizens as well as the state giving the citizens their own responsibilities means that citizens respect the state for the fact that it does not limit them. To examine this from a point of view that does not rely on moral consequentialism and a utility based principle, it is possible to say that the state should afford people liberty and freedom because the starting point of any rational moral calculus should be the admission that an individual is the best judge of what is in his own interest. To not give people choice is ultimately an idea that dehumanises people. As such, the only time where freedoms should truly be restricted is when allowing the freedom results in a greater level of dehumanisation among the people. So for example, we prevent murder because allowing people to kill one another results in allowing some people to entirely remove other people’s ability to choose on purpose.\n",
            "[Doc 2298]: Sexuality should not be within the purview of the state. The state maintains order and security and provides essential services. Sex education does not fall within its responsibility. Sexuality is for many people deeply personal and should be respected as such; young people should be allowed to explore their sexuality independently and with the guidance of family, not under the watching eye of the state. Inevitably teachers’ personal opinions on sexuality will bleed into their teaching, as will that of the state officials that set the teaching standards for the subject. In this way there is always a normative judgment in sex education that will be seen as the state mandating certain sexual behaviour and practice. This fundamentally attacks the rights of individuals to develop their mode of sexual expression independent of the nanny state’s instruction and can irrevocably harm peoples’ sexual identity.\n",
            "[Doc 763]: In the past, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in 2018, the US was in bad company. Only the United Arab Emirates, an oil-rich Middle Eastern country with fewer people than Michigan, Puerto Rico, a US territory, and Comoros had higher top corporate tax rates than seen in the US. Now, the US rates among the UK (20 percent), China (25 percent) and Canada (28 percent). Before the corporate tax reduction, other countries had a competitive advantage over the US when looking to attract businesses. This is no longer the case and shows that raising tax rates may accelerate this trend, and every time a company moves overseas, it costs the US both jobs and tax revenue.\n",
            "[Doc 1774]: Since education is something that the state is obligated to provide, any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state, even in private education. If religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state, which undermines the separation of religion and the state, which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy.\n",
            "[Doc 1335]: How will the severity and legality of flogging be monitored? How will it be reconciled with existing liberal democratic value sets? The majority of western liberal democracies are party to inter-governmental and supranational agreements that expressly forbid states from using torture or degrading or inhuman punishments in any capacity. The mark of a modern, liberal state is that it uses authority and engagement rather than raw power to protect its citizens. The use of force or power by the state and its agents is harder to regulate and costlier to compensate when it is misapplied. Liberal democracies, apart from being agents of realpolitik, are also aspirational bodies that should strive to reflect and adhere to the values they were created to defend. Arbitrary, coercive force and violence is one of the core harms that a state must guard against. Violence is said to be the preserve of criminals and those acting against the values of society. Therefore, as an aspirational body, the state should hold itself to a higher standard of behaviour than such individuals. Violence, as most liberal constitutions make clear, should only ever be employed by the state as a last resort. Where a state has the means to do so, even if those means are costly or politically contentious, it should endeavour to achieve peace and order within its own borders without wielding power. At its broadest, the liberal democratic ideology holds that the rights and autonomy of individual citizens should be only be infringed in order to protect the rights and autonomy of other citizens. This principle would be violated if the state resorted to corporal sentencing as a way of satisfying a mob-like demand for visible and harsh criminal sentencing. No citizen of a liberal democracy has a right to demand that another citizen, criminal or not, should be subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering by the state.\n",

            "[Doc 1392]: States violate their right to non-intervention through systematic human rights abuses by violating the contract of their state. States derive their rights of control and on the monopoly of violence through what is called the ‘social contract.’ A state gains its right to rule over a population by the people of that state submitting to it their rights to unlimited liberty and the use of force on others in society to the state in return for protection by that state . The individual is sovereign and submits his rights to the state who derives sovereignty from the accumulation of an entire population’s sovereignty. This is where the legitimacy and right to control a population by force comes from. When a state is no longer protecting its people, but rather is systematically removing the security and eroding away the most basic rights and life of those citizens, they no longer are fulfilling the contract and it is void, thus removing their right to sovereignty and immunity from intervention. The necessity of intervention in such a case comes from the desperation of the situation. Regimes that use the machinery of the state and their enriched elite against their populations hold all the wealth, power and military might in the country. There is no hope for self-protection for individuals facing a powerful, organized, and well-funded national army. In such a case, the sovereignty of the individuals need to be protected from the state that abuses them.\n",
            "[Doc 1260]: There is clearly not universal or even widespread acceptance of the idea that internet access should be a human right. Human rights are dependent upon the state, the desires of the community, and that depends upon the state’s socio economic context. International law is based upon several sources; state practice, customary law, treaties and judicial decisions.\n",
            "[Doc 3322]: The problem with being so generous is that people are encouraged not to work. People know that if they do not work, if they sit on their backside, their living costs will be catered for well by the state. This means that there are people in the state who can work but do not. They do not contribute to their skills to that society. This is not an effective state. In an effective state everyone needs to contribute what they can to the society and their economy.\n",
            "[Doc 2292]: The state funds the education system through taxation. Parents who do not send their children to state schools still pay those same taxes. Therefore, these taxes are spent on a smaller number of schools and there is more money per child in the state sector than there would be if we banned private education. In 2008 there were 569,080 students in independent schools in England,(BBC 2009)  - this would be a very large extra burden for state schools to bear. These students’ parents are therefore not only paying for their own children but also for students to study at state schools as well.\n",
            "[Doc 1661]: The role of the state is to protect its people and to create the conditions for its people’s prosperity. The Church does not share these objectives. The Church’s objectives are, instead, to either convert as many people as possible to its own religion, and to ‘save souls’ brining people into its own perceived afterlife. The current confusion of state and Church, therefore, is likely to cloud the state’s judgement and limit the state’s ability to provide the maximum possible prosperity and security for its people.\n",
            "[Doc 1512]: Gender selection technology should be available, at whatever cost the market dictates, to those who can afford the process and wish to choose the sex of their children. There should be no other restrictions on the couples wishing to go through with the process, other than an assurance that the mother is physically able and willing. As it is not an essential procedure, the state should not be expected to subsidize either the process or the development of the technology. Nevertheless, the private sector should be encouraged to develop the technology and continue to provide the public with a path to maximise their own happiness.\n",
            "[Doc 2556]: Even though tests are developed by states independently, state scores are compared with results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), ensuring each state's assessments are equally challenging and that gains in a state's test scores are valid.\n",
            "[Doc 3536]: On the disparity between private and state schools, the correct way to improve the education for children in state schools is to spend more money on state schools, devote more time, energy and enthusiasm to them. Preventing a minority from having a certain type of education is not the way to help improve the majority’s education. By and large, the complaint is that private schools are doing well and providing a good education, whilst state schools lag behind. It is in all our interests to set the standard of education as high as we can – you do this by raising state schools to the supposed standard of private schools, not by depriving children of a private education.\n",

In a case about the constitutionality of a tariff on goods trafficked between the island and the mainland, the U.S. Supreme Court defined Puerto Rico in 1901 as “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense” because it was neither a state of the American union nor an independent republic. As the U.S. and Puerto Rico mark the anniversary of the invasion on July 25, 2023, the island maintains a status similar to a colony because it lacks sovereignty and full representation in the federal government.

How would these countries be able to accommodate an influx of refugees during times of poor economic conditions? The newcomers require jobs to complete their integration, and it would be paradoxical for countries to commit to finding occupations for foreigners while their own citizens go jobless. As immigrants and unemployment affect each European country differently, not to mention France’s problem of immigrant-related terrorism , it seems unproductive for EU leaders to think a one-size-fits-all policy would work.\n",

            "[Doc 4076]: When people are allowed to enter into pre-nups they can ensure themselves against things that they fear. For example, when the richer person enters into the marriage with the knowledge that his/her wealth is protected, the marriage will be better off because it will be clear that the other person is not marrying for money. As some legal frameworks necessitate sharing wealth 50/50, this could mean that assets will have to be sold, so that it’s worth can be divided equally. This will create a problem when some of those assets are inherited and have, therefore, sentimental value. This heightened sense of security will benefit both parties, as they can be much more confident with the marriage and not be suspicious of one another. \"Making a prenup may actually strengthen your relationship. While people often imagine that negotiating a prenup leads to conflict, communicating about money matters can actually improve the quality of your relationship and support good communication in your marriage.\"\n",

The ICC, as an effective court and with an independent judiciary, provides a suitable and unbiased climate for these cases to be heard in. While it is difficult to give any former head of state a fair trial, it is even more so in cases involving states divided along ethnic and political fault lines where any conviction could be seen as one based on continuing hatreds rather than evidence and criminal procedure.

But the question is, *What kind of result do we look for?* And this is, I think, the most interesting question in this situation, because we have been trying to change the direction of the European Union for decades, since the 1990s. So, maybe Europe needs a shock from our good old friend America to start a true debate, because there was no debate in the European mainstream.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 440]: Israel has many integrated cities, like Haifa, Jaffa and Lod, to name a few, where Jews and Muslim citizens live side by side peacefully, living and working together, challenging the notion of apartheid-like segregation. Israel also promotes freedom of religion , as its Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters in Jerusalem, whose residents also live side by side, prove. Citizens and visitors are allowed to pray and practice their religion freely. Another key argument against labeling Israel as an apartheid state is its democratic structure and commitment to democratic principles. Arab Israeli citizens , who compose 21% of the Israeli population, can and have served in Israel’s parliament and other positions in government, including diplomatic roles and as judges in the country’s courts, including on the Supreme Court . They are entitled to the same municipal and educational services and have the same municipal voting rights as Jewish Israelis. Israel has also allowed its female and minority citizens to vote and run in open and free elections since its founding in 1948, decades before other Arab or Muslim countries introduced suffrage for women .\n",
            "[Doc 1166]: Netanyahu’s term has not seen many breakthroughs in peace talks with the Palestinians, but he has opened new doors throughout the Middle East and beyond. Most exceptional has been the shift in attitude of the Gulf states toward Israel, led by Saudi Arabia. Sparked by Netanyahu’s leadership in confronting Iran, Sunni leaders started quietly coordinating with Israel on security issues, as the Iranian threat began to carry more resonance than Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. While official diplomatic relations are still some ways off, Saudi officials now speak of accepting Israel as does Bahrain and the U.A.E .– unthinkable a generation ago. Half a century after fighting two devastating wars, Israel and Egypt have also seen their relations hit a high-water mark. While there won’t be a hint of peace between Israel and Syria any time soon, under Netanyahu, Israel has taken in and treated Syrian refugees from their civil war. He has further strengthened ties with India , Japan , and Africa . And he is one of few world leaders who has been able to influence US President Donald Trump .\n",
            "[Doc 146]: Along the West Bank, Israel has built a 439-foot separation barrier wall that physically separates the Palestinian territories from Israel. Within the West Bank, Israel has implemented a system of checkpoints and segregated roads that are separate for Palestinian and Israeli traffic, all to further restrict Palestinian movement. Many Palestinians face military checkpoints to travel through and out of the area. These restrictions on their freedom of movement, access to resources, and ability to build or develop their communities perpetuate a sense of division and inequality, reminiscent of apartheid-era South Africa.\n",
            "[Doc 1015]: Labeling Israel as an apartheid state oversimplifies the complexities of the multi-layered Israeli-Palestinian conflict. First, Palestinians fall under three vastly different groups based on geography: people who live in Gaza, people who live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Arab Israelis who live in Israel. There is no such as thing as one Palestinian entity that Israel addresses in one specific way. Second, what outsiders might see as Israeli hostility toward Palestinians can be seen as a reaction to life-threating violence . The history of conflict and terrorism – which isn’t relegated to history but, sadly, a part of the country’s present – has led to necessary defensive security measures, such as border checkpoints and controls, aimed at protecting Israeli citizens from repeated terrorist attacks. Israelis strongly feel that if they don’t manage the Palestinian situation, they and their family members can be raped and murdered . It’s as simple as that. Even Palestinians who had legal work permits to cross into Israel from Gaza and had been welcomed as friends into the kibbutzim where they worked were later found to be guilty of leading and/or aiding Hamas terrorists in their murderous massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.\n",

            "[Doc 493]: Proponents of the apartheid label should consider Israel’s previous peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, as proof that Israel is interested in building bridges, not tearing them down. Over the decades, despite ongoing violence, Israel has participated in peace talks with the Palestinian Authority (PA) and has made concessions in pursuit of a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The IDF pulled out of Gaza unilaterally in 2005, giving the Palestinians an opportunity to build their own country. It wasn’t a perfect situation, but thriving and nation-building were viable options. One of the first acts on behalf of the Palestinians in Gaza following Israeli withdrawal was to loot and destroy the greenhouses that were positioned there by donors for their welfare. Israelis kept on watching as Hamas was elected and made a clear choice to divert all resources to war infrastructure instead of the welfare of its citizens – with billions of dollars used to create tunnel networks of terror, which still house Israeli civilian hostages – instead of building a self-sustaining society and tourist-friendly destination.\n",

While Europe and the US suffered through a recession and lackluster recovering, Israel’s economy barely faltered . Despite stresses from many directions, Israel’s economy has continued to thrive . The country has earned its reputation as the Star-Up Nation , with more companies listed on the NASDAQ than any countries outside the US and China. It spends more money than any other OECD country as a percentage of GDP, and is among the heavyweights in total venture capital . Netanyahu deserves much of the credit for Israel’s economic prosperity.\n",
            "[Doc 2723]: Affirmative Action was necessary to combat racist individuals in positions of power, and their attitudes have not yet fully changed. It therefore remains necessary to ensure protection for those who were disadvantaged by apartheid.\n",
            "[Doc 1179]: Israel’s legal system treats Jews and non-Jews differently. Just look at the “ Law of Return ,” which grants automatic citizenship to Jews worldwide, leaving out that automatic right for Muslim and Christian Arab Israelis, as well as for Druze and Bedouin; this also contrasts sharply with laws governing the Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem, who are allowed residency in Israel but not Israeli citizenship. Meanwhile, the three million Palestinians living in the West Bank are also subject to different laws , depending upon whether they are under the legal jurisdiction of Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which is decided by geographic area. Palestinians in the West Bank have seen their land seized and used for Israeli settlements and infrastructure, not to mention destroyed as a form of collective punishment if someone in their family has been involved in a terrorist activity.\n",
            "[Doc 1705]: The state places rules upon its citizens for the overall betterment of society. However, whenever possible the state also affords citizens liberty. This is the case because the state sees that when people are free to do what they want they are able to make better decisions for themselves and further are able to interact with the state better. They do this because they feel that the state is allowing them to make their own decisions and as such the state is showing its trust in its citizens. This bond of trust between the state and the citizens as well as the state giving the citizens their own responsibilities means that citizens respect the state for the fact that it does not limit them. To examine this from a point of view that does not rely on moral consequentialism and a utility based principle, it is possible to say that the state should afford people liberty and freedom because the starting point of any rational moral calculus should be the admission that an individual is the best judge of what is in his own interest. To not give people choice is ultimately an idea that dehumanises people. As such, the only time where freedoms should truly be restricted is when allowing the freedom results in a greater level of dehumanisation among the people. So for example, we prevent murder because allowing people to kill one another results in allowing some people to entirely remove other people’s ability to choose on purpose.\n",
            "[Doc 3322]: The problem with being so generous is that people are encouraged not to work. People know that if they do not work, if they sit on their backside, their living costs will be catered for well by the state. This means that there are people in the state who can work but do not. They do not contribute to their skills to that society. This is not an effective state. In an effective state everyone needs to contribute what they can to the society and their economy.\n",
            "[Doc 1774]: Since education is something that the state is obligated to provide, any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state, even in private education. If religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state, which undermines the separation of religion and the state, which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy.\n",
            "[Doc 1392]: States violate their right to non-intervention through systematic human rights abuses by violating the contract of their state. States derive their rights of control and on the monopoly of violence through what is called the ‘social contract.’ A state gains its right to rule over a population by the people of that state submitting to it their rights to unlimited liberty and the use of force on others in society to the state in return for protection by that state . The individual is sovereign and submits his rights to the state who derives sovereignty from the accumulation of an entire population’s sovereignty. This is where the legitimacy and right to control a population by force comes from. When a state is no longer protecting its people, but rather is systematically removing the security and eroding away the most basic rights and life of those citizens, they no longer are fulfilling the contract and it is void, thus removing their right to sovereignty and immunity from intervention. The necessity of intervention in such a case comes from the desperation of the situation. Regimes that use the machinery of the state and their enriched elite against their populations hold all the wealth, power and military might in the country. There is no hope for self-protection for individuals facing a powerful, organized, and well-funded national army. In such a case, the sovereignty of the individuals need to be protected from the state that abuses them.\n",
            "[Doc 188]: The denial of basic rights and freedoms can be summed up in one word: Gaza . While Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank may face legal disparities and limitations on their basic rights of movement and citizenship, the Palestinians in Gaza increasingly lack any rights or access to humanitarian care . Israel may have pulled out of Gaza in 2005, but its 2023 war on the Palestinians in the enclave has resulted in pure destruction and human suffering . Its excessive response to the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, depriving hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of food, essential health services, hygiene, clean water, and human rights. In many critics’ minds, this military action is worse than apartheid.\n",
            "[Doc 2292]: The state funds the education system through taxation. Parents who do not send their children to state schools still pay those same taxes. Therefore, these taxes are spent on a smaller number of schools and there is more money per child in the state sector than there would be if we banned private education. In 2008 there were 569,080 students in independent schools in England,(BBC 2009)  - this would be a very large extra burden for state schools to bear. These students’ parents are therefore not only paying for their own children but also for students to study at state schools as well.\n",
            "[Doc 753]: Archaeological excavations in the Near East, Middle East and particularly in the Fertile Crescent, which includes Israel , have led to astonishing discoveries over the years, many of which relate to the biblical world. Mosaics, ancient fortresses, pottery and other items unearthed, cleaned and dated by trained and versed archaeologists have pointed time after time to an event or epoch straight out of the Bible. For example, archaeological site surveyor Gila Cook discovered an inscribed stone within a newly excavated wall in Israel. This stone contains the first historical evidence of King David apart from in the Bible. In addition, the Temple Mount Sifting Project uncovered tile floors from the Jewish Temple, built by King Herod. As voiced by journalist Dennis Leap , “Archaeology has confirmed without question the historical accuracy of the Bible.”\n",
            "[Doc 2298]: Sexuality should not be within the purview of the state. The state maintains order and security and provides essential services. Sex education does not fall within its responsibility. Sexuality is for many people deeply personal and should be respected as such; young people should be allowed to explore their sexuality independently and with the guidance of family, not under the watching eye of the state. Inevitably teachers’ personal opinions on sexuality will bleed into their teaching, as will that of the state officials that set the teaching standards for the subject. In this way there is always a normative judgment in sex education that will be seen as the state mandating certain sexual behaviour and practice. This fundamentally attacks the rights of individuals to develop their mode of sexual expression independent of the nanny state’s instruction and can irrevocably harm peoples’ sexual identity.\n",
            "[Doc 2556]: Even though tests are developed by states independently, state scores are compared with results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), ensuring each state's assessments are equally challenging and that gains in a state's test scores are valid.\n",
            "[Doc 3536]: On the disparity between private and state schools, the correct way to improve the education for children in state schools is to spend more money on state schools, devote more time, energy and enthusiasm to them. Preventing a minority from having a certain type of education is not the way to help improve the majority’s education. By and large, the complaint is that private schools are doing well and providing a good education, whilst state schools lag behind. It is in all our interests to set the standard of education as high as we can – you do this by raising state schools to the supposed standard of private schools, not by depriving children of a private education.\n",
            "[Doc 1260]: There is clearly not universal or even widespread acceptance of the idea that internet access should be a human right.

In that manner, college athletes are no different than other college students who practice or inten in hospitals, law firms or advertising agencies for little to no money. So why should athletes be get paid while the others don’t? A lot of young adults today are impatient and lack the ability to delay gratification. College can teach them a great life lesson: in real life, you have to work hard and wait for your chance. Paying big money to any college student, athlete or academic is far from being the ideal preparation for life.\n",
            "[Doc 129]: Through the EC , residents of smaller states are given a step in determining America’s presidents. This is because larger states’ electoral votes represent a much higher proportion of people than do the smaller states’. For example, one electoral vote in New York stands for 550,000 people, while the same represents 232,000 people in South Dakota. Additionally, while voter turnout dictates the popular vote, it only strengthens the disproportion of voter weight in electoral votes. Take Oregon and Oklahoma, both states with 7 electoral votes; only 52% of Oklahoma’s eligible voters turned out for the 2016 election, as opposed to Oregon’s 67%, giving Oklahoma voters much greater weight per vote.\n",

            "[Doc 2670]: If the election depended solely on the popular vote, then candidates could limit campaigning to heavily-populated areas or specific regions.

Without the electoral college, groups such as Iowa farmers and Ohio factory workers would be ignored in favor of pandering to metropolitan areas with higher population densities, leaving rural areas and small towns marginalized.\n",
            "[Doc 275]: An important argument coming from those who oppose paying college athletes is the expected difficulty involved with implementing such a move. The following are just some of the questions that pinpoint the complexities: Who will pay the college athletes? How often will they receive pay? Will there be a salary cap? Who gets paid and how much? Will female college athletes benefit as much as their male counterparts? Theoretically, the athletes to get paid the most should be the ones playing the sports that bring in the big money, namely, men’s college basketball and football players. This is capitalism, and this is how it works in America. Time will tell who ultimately benefits the most from this decision.\n",
            "[Doc 761]: While many argue that a college degree may no longer be enough or even the only way to get you in the door of an office, the opportunities you take advantage of on a college campus could make or break a company’s decision to hire you. From writing for the school paper to interning in a biotech laboratory or volunteering to do admin work of a cherished organization, the world of potential job experience is open on college campuses in a way it may not be once you graduate. Not only that, but you can also meet professionals and mentors who are important in and to your field of choice. Networking with influential professors or industry leaders as an enthusiastic student can lead to advantages later on when it comes time to secure a job. The industry-related activities and connections available to you in college are rare and can strengthen your skill set and open opportunities in a way that will make you stand out in the eyes of a future employer.\n",

            "[Doc 502]: One of the best aspects of college sports is the players’ enthusiasm. Their love and passion for their respective game is admirable and infectious. But, there is a downside to it; in their fervor to play their best, many college athletes suffer serious injuries that sometimes prematurely end their career. Setting aside the disturbing fact that a career-ending injury will stop their scholarship, those college athletes put their bodies at risk of permanent damage, without being paid. Hurting your knee might leave you limping for the rest of your life. Suffering concussions can cause dementia and depression, not to mention CTE . Those college athletes who put their bodies on the line for each training session and game they play deserve to be paid for the health risks they are taking.\n",

I often go scavenging in the bins behind my local supermarket I don't agree with the waste and see it as a cheaper and worthwhile thing to do. don't get me wrong some of the food is bad for you and unedible once its chucked out like meat for example but this just requires some common sense on the part of the person who goes rooting.\n",

If you have the chance to get a degree, take it; it can help you advance in life. Perhaps education should be a basic right, but unfortunately, the dire lack of schooling for people around the globe paints a very different picture. For millions, primary education isn’t even an option , let alone higher education. In fact, around 60 million children across the world are prevented from going to elementary school each day, which cancels their possibility of attending college. There are many people worldwide who die never having turned the page of a book.

It would quickly be seen as illegitimate to allow sixteen and seventeen year olds the vote in some elections and not others without a good justification.

So if the age becomes 18, there will still be plenty of 21 year olds drinking. Lowering the age would only allow people to start their habit at an even younger age. This could lead to more and more adults suffering from alcoholism. By starting at 18, kids will be able to build a tolerance to alcohol and by the time they get to college they will be experienced drinkers. Instead of saving their fun for the weekend like most college students, they will feel the need to drink through out their school week, therefore falling behind on their studies and even potentially losing their social life and friends. This ultimately would lead to failing out of school, not being able to hold a steady job, and not being able to get the job that a college education could have gotten them.\n",

The internet makes it possible to be learning at home, there are even many computer games that help with learning. Homework clashes with these other activities. It can damage family relationships as it means parents have to try and make their children do their homework.\n",

Let’s say for the sake of argument that, for example, an impressive $100,000-a-year salary for a college athlete would grant him only a few hundred dollars more per year than a scholarship. Let’s just estimate that a full athletic scholarship at an NCAA Division I university is about $65,000 a year. This includes tuition, room, board, and books (if you enroll at a college with high tuition). In contrast, a salary will be subjected to federal and state income taxes. Therefore, out of the $100,000, a net of $65,100 would remain for the student. The difference is marginal.\n",
            "[Doc 2989]: The very fact that Maths is compulsory is causing it to be unpopular. People do not want to do what they are forced to do. People enjoy and wilfully enter into voluntary work but hate and dread their paid work, even when it largely involves performing the same tasks and one has the added incentive of pay, because they feel they have chosen to do the former while they are forced into the latter because of the need for money. Young people will do the compulsory subjects 'just because they have to', putting very little effort into them, while focussing their time on the topics that they choose to do. Making mathematics an optional subject will make it appear that it is the same as another GCSE, meaning that they will choose it because they are interested in mathematics, then be happy and motivated to study it.\n",
            "[Doc 1959]: If the country is in trouble is the army the best placed to take over and manage the country better than it has been in the past? This may plausibly be true if the reason democracy is failing is a large scale insurgency or near civil war but in almost every other case it is not the best institution. The army is trained to fight not to govern. The generals who take over top positions are used to running a bureaucracy that has to respond to politicians, not one that has to respond to the people. Politicians may be corrupt, venal, or unpopular but at the least they are open about what they stand for. They have a manifesto and a clear ideology which if the people don't agree with they wont be voted for. This is not the case with generals; the chances are they have a bureaucratic desire to maintain the power and funding for the military but otherwise there is likely to be little known about their politics. Finally for those who are being overthrown the electorate has had a chance to investigate their policies, their past, to question their views and catch the candidate out when they are not consistent. The candidate came through an electoral test and media grilling. When there is a coup there is no such chance to determine if the coup leader is the right man for the job.\n",
            "[Doc 1276]: Genuine transparency and accountability of government action is not only in the interests of those who also have the right to vote for that government or who support it through the payment of taxes. The functioning of immigration services would seem to be a prime example. Maximising access to information relating to government decisions by dint of its automatic publication of information relating to those decisions ensures that all those affected will have recourse to the facts behind any decision. If, for example, a nation’s aid budget is cut or redirected, why should the citizens of the affected nation not have a right to know why ? If, as is frequently the case, it has happened because of an action or inaction by their own government, then it is important that they know. Equally if such a decision were taken for electoral gain, they at least have the right to know that there is nothing they or their government could do about it.\n",
            "[Doc 3376]: It is a waste for the supermarket to just throw the food away when someone else can eat it, and then not even let people take it away. Only the poorest and hungriest people would resort to scavenging from the back of a shop, they need the food the most and can't afford to buy it, so why not let them have the food? The food couldn't have been sold anyway, the shop can't stay open if it has no power and they couldn't have refrigerated the food, so they couldn't store it for long enough for someone to buy. If the shop actually had a plan to store it somewhere else and sell it at a reduced price or or give it to charity, that would be different, but they are just throwing thousands of pounds worth of food away. Such a policy would make the shop more popular in the long run.\n",

It was later revealed that Nixon, himself, took aggressive steps to subsequently cover up the criminal robbery and other related illegal activities. Watergate was an entirely domestic affair. In contrast, U.S. intelligence officials confirmed that there was a massive effort by the Russians to intervene in the 2016 presidential election through cyberwarfare. (While Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia’s election meddling , it did not fully exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice during the Justice Department’s subsequent investigations into the matter.) While questions still remain, which the newly released Mueller report may finally answer, what is known for sure is that a foreign power – in fact, to a large extent, a hostile foreign power – did interfere with US domestic issues for its own purposes.\n",

Offering foreign workers a “voice” in the society in which they live legitimizes their place within it, and makes them part of it.

Such participation is empowering and will encourage people to be proactive in knowing their rights as workers.

Foreign workers are inherently vulnerable to exploitation “…Many live and work in conditions described as akin to \"modern slavery\", apart from facing discrimination, the denial of labour rights and even violence...” Regardless of their rights under the law, socio-political marginalization often leaves them in a position with no power.

However, this right can be limited when those actions are oppositional to the aims of the home state in which they are incorporated. The sale of surveillance technology to undemocratic regimes stands against the avowed aims of democracies and against their strategic interests in bolstering democracy abroad and maintaining a reputation for fair dealing. For this reason it is perfectly legitimate for governments to ban the corporations within their borders from selling dangerous technologies to foreign governments. Such is already the case with many kinds of strategic technology, especially weapons technology. If corporations wish to benefit from these provisions they must be willing to accept the instructions of the states that house them regarding what can and cannot be sold to foreign powers.\n",

Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006.

The UN Charter, signed after World War II, requires authorization from the UN Security Council to use force. Respecting an internationalized body’s authority to decide on such issues is preferable to allowing any one country to act alone. International coalition forces like NATO are in place to judge, admonish or respond to a country’s aggressions, case in point Russia’s invasions of Ukraine , Crimea and Georgia over the past decade. With such coalitions, it should not be up to America to have to take on the role of being the world’s police.\n",

Human rights abuses happen around the world because there is no mechanism to stop it. Oppressive regimes thrive simply because there is no real, coherent deterrent to their abuses. Sanctions target their populations not their personal enrichment they gain through siphoning off money from domestic industry, diplomatic sanctions have no tangible impact on states and peacekeepers are useless when there is no peace to keep. The only true deterrent to regimes around the world is the danger that a strong military rival from outside will intervene and stop them and remove them from power. Sending a strong message that the international community can and will intervene in the cases of human rights abuses seriously increases the costs in regimes' cost-benefit-analysis of state behaviour and deters them from committing human rights abuses for fear of military defeat from abroad.\n",

Part of the problem is that we value our right to a private life and that we should have control over that to the extent of being able to decide how much information others know about us. To a large extent this is an issue of trust; we (sometimes wrongly) trust our friends and others with information about us. We often trust faceless entities; companies and governments too though usually to less of an extent. But a lot of that trust is as a result of their willingness to tell us what they know about us, to provide information in return, or to provide methods for us to restrict what they know.

Nobel Prizes are just one way to measure. In 2009, 40 percent of articles published in biomedical journals came from the US, three times as many as its nearest competitor.

Toft calls this the rise of kinetic diplomacy, “the use of force first over other tools of state.” She says, “Traditionally, you think of diplomacy first and use of force as last. Pointing to U.S. involvements in Vietnam and Afghanistan, neither of which ended in victory, she says, “It's much more difficult today.” That’s another argument for reconsidering the increased reliance on military intervention. Toft likens the current state of U.S. foreign policy to a game of whack-a-mole, in which the U.S. sees issues popping up and has “only one way of dealing with them, which is the hammer” of military force.\n",

U.S. Army soldiers assigned to the 10th Mountain Division stand security at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul, Afghanistan, August 15, 2021. It is these unsuccessful post–Cold War interventions that have engendered serious doubts among policymakers and the public about the role of force in U.S. foreign policy. Even so, U.S. decisionmaking still has a strong bias in favor of military intervention. When crises emerge, the pressure for a U.S. military response is often immediate, on the grounds that it is better to try to control the situation than to do nothing.

In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.24 In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest).\n",

In Sudan, if the war-related famine again becomes severe, dividing the country into an Arab north and a Christian south may save the vast majority of threatened Sudanese lives at the lowest cost in dollars—and in the blood of intervening troops. But muscular interventions in wars like those in Angola and Congo will probably not happen until more countries develop the military capabilities for such operations—which brings us to the final question. Although the United States need not create a specialized armed force for peace operations, it should modify its military force structure to lessen the strain of various types of limited missions around the world. Even if such countries cannot be expected to lead forcible interventions, they can provide valuable combat forces that enable peacekeeping missions to uphold ceasefires and peace accords under challenge.\n",

            "[Doc 64]: Militancy pervades the ranks of the far-left and the far-right. More than idolizing violent purveyors of their ideologies (think far-right’s Hitler to the far-left’s Che Guevara ), many far-right and far-left movements are vehement in their rejection of non-violence and employ it regularly. Between 1993 and 2017, right-wing groups are said to have carried out 150 attacks on US soil – from shooting to bombings. Since 2017, there have been a number of far-right terror attacks in the US, not to mention their role in the US Capital riots . However, political violence has also been perpetrated by militant offshoots of left-wing groups, beginning with the 1960’s Weathermen and continuing until today with the Antifa movement.\n",
            "[Doc 1062]: People on the outermost poles of the political spectrum, meaning on both the far-left and the far-right, often view themselves as aggrieved parties. Interestingly, one study found that having faced adversity – namely violence, loss of a loved one, or experiencing illness or disability – is indeed a predictor of extreme political views ; the more adversity people faced, the more likely they were to lean to the far-right or far-left in their ideologies. Experiencing adversity may explain the rhetoric of victimization that permeates the far-left as well as the far-right. White Nationalists complain of cultural and economic obliteration at the hands of multicultural movements and affirmative action, while proponents of the far-left demand restitution for the silencing of minority groups via discriminatory legislation, the recent rise in popularity of white nationalists , police brutality and micro-aggressions .\n",
            "[Doc 191]: The far-right and the far-left have dramatically different interpretations of the past – interpretations which dictate their political stances and calls to action. The far-right expresses nostalgia for the past and actively works to preserve their history, regardless of what that might mean in today’s context. For right-wing Southerners, like the members of Save Southern Heritage , this means protecting statues of famous Confederates, and decrying the removal of the Confederate flag from public buildings or the removal of Confederate monuments. Conversely, the far-left (and in this case, many liberals) associates the past with its ills – slavery, sexism, and other injustices. History and its institutions are not to be preserved and cherished, but rather, an embarking point from which to begin reform.\n",

Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, it could be argued that without families to support or even necessarily the need to support themselves, the average college student has more free time than others to develop defined political views. As such, it is hardly surprising that constituents on the far-right and far-left are overwhelmingly educated and even well-off (a trend that held even for the Hezbollah fighters of the 1980s and 90s).

The difficulty is that most publications work on the basis that there is a narrative that is already understood in order to function. It’s simply impossible to give the full backstory to everything that goes into print . The only way to avoid newspapers being constantly full of replies to irrelevant data would be to give a far broader right of reply to the opinions presented or the conclusions draw – the actions where journalism really has its power. Many newspapers already do this out of professional courteousy and respect for the truth, for example the guardian has a ‘Response’ column in its Comment is free section. The idea of a right of reply is fine in theory but, in reality, it is difficult to see how it would have any real impact on the day to day working of the press. This concern comes before any consideration of how it would work in relation to the more pervasive media of broadcast and online news outlets – or is this punishment to be reserved as the last nail in the coffin of the printed press?

This is an especially important consideration for those interested in careers outside of the legal profession. Spending some of that tuition subsidizing an internship on Capitol Hill or with a Think Tank or Lobbying firm would be far more likely to lead to later employment in politics than earning a JD and likely offer a politically interested potential law student a far more entertaining and enjoyable experience.

However, within America, even attacks on the US Capital couldn’t weaken the country’s democratic and Constitutional principles. American democracy does not only speak to political realities but to cultural ones as well.

            "[Doc 4086]: According to the Geneva convention the principle of proportionality states that harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated in an attack on a military objective. Military objective is defined are defined to be those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage . When a state is in conflict with a non-state actor we think that a legitimate military objective is the capture (extraterriotorial if neccessary) of combatants of that non-state actor. In the case of terrorist networks individuals can bare a lot of power. There are terrorist ''king-pins'', who control and moralize other terrorists and are in possession of important information about the network. The capture of these individuals can be a blow to the terrorist organization, because it loses an experienced member who can train others and demoralizes the organization. Of course it also disarms this individual and limits his capacity to threaten the state further. With this we establish that there is a definite military advantage in the capture of such individuals. But is it proportional to the damage done to civilians? To justify the proportionality of extra-territorial rendition we have to look at what kind of damage it can bring to the civilian population of other states. The proposition has brought out that sometimes innocent individuals will be captured. Against this we argue that during the course of the trial the innocence or guilt of the captured individuals has to emerge. When it is established that the individual was indeed innocent the damage done to that person can be reversed by returning him to his home state. If however the individual is guilty, his capture would have potentially lead to the saving of lives of many civilians and thus is a proportional act. For proportional response to ever be applied, it is required that a country should have access to the entire spectrum of possible responses. Otherwise, it is impossible to select the response which matches the cause with the required severity. When options are taken from the table, what happens? Inevitably, a country will be left between two options, one which is less severe than that required, and one which is more severe. Even if we assume the country has mercy in its soul, and opts for the less response, the lack of proportionality will mean that it will not have fully served its purpose in cutting off the threat which provoked it, thereby making it less effective than the response that direct proportionality requires. Unfortunately, even this best case scenario is unlikely to happen. Countries are less sensitive to foreign deaths than those of their own citizens. Therefore, the path most chosen is likely to be that of greater than proportional vengeance, and therefore greater than proportional bloodshed. The importance of allowing small scale solutions to small scale problems is one widely recognised, at least implicitly, by modern nation states. Most nation states operate intelligence agencies, and many of these conduct operations overseas, often without the knowledge of local governments. And yet, the operations of these agents, who are the agents of a foreign state, and often involve the collection of sensitive information, or materials, is not, and is unlikely to ever be, considered a warcrime. The reason, is because without these small scale, surgical instruments at hand, states would have only far heavier tools for dismantling threats to their existence. In the case of extroardinary rendition. Certainly, there are some scenarios when a suspect would simply be left alone. But is it to be expected that any government would simply allow an individual who is plotting the murder of its citizens to continue unobstructed? Far more likely for goverrnments to take more drastic measures, from openly declared strikes and incursions, to placing economic, military, or political pressure on state leaders to permit the extradition and interrogation of their suspect. Both alternatives are far more damaging to long term political relations between the countries, and far less likely to be effective in stemming the short term problem. War crimes law should be designed to defuse conflict, not incite it.\n",

In comparison, the polio epidemic hit New York in 1916 and continued ravaging the public until the mid-1950s when a polio vaccine was introduced. According to the World Economic Forum, it usually takes around 10 years for a vaccine to be researched, developed, tested, approved and manufactured. Of that, the first 2-5 years are for discovery research alone. Today, scientific researchers and pharmaceutical companies have worked at unprecedented speed to create a vaccine .

Because noone can deny that what ever happens as a result of the elections the sixteen year olds also are effected by the policies of the election winners.

            "[Doc 1922]: Many human rights are not compatible with each other. If two things are both 'fundamental' then they must both be equally true and important. However the protection of any human right requires the violation of others. For example the right to security of person requires the existence of a police force, which must be funded by taxes coercively obtained, which violates the right to property. Similarly the right of a wife to divorce her husband to protect her own happiness may compromise his own happiness. A right cannot be 'fundamental' if it must be weighed up, balanced against and possibly compromised in light of another 'fundamental' right, as this would mean they exist in conflict with each other.\n",
            "[Doc 1938]: Perhaps the most basic and fundamental of all our rights. However, with every right comes a choice. The right to speech does not remove the option to remain silent; the right to vote brings with it the right to abstain. In the same way, the right to choose to die is implicit in the right to life. The degree to which physical pain and psychological distress can be tolerated is different in all humans. Quality of life judgements are private and personal, thus only the sufferer can make relevant decisions. People are given a large degree of autonomy within their lives and since deciding to end your life does not physically harm anyone else, it should be within your rights to decide when you wish to die. While the act of suicide does remove option to choose life, most cases in which physician assisted suicide is reasonable, death is the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process. The choice for the patient, therefore, is not to die, but to cease suffering and tto chose the time and manner of their death.\n",
            "[Doc 1501]: By focusing on women and their problems, feminism fails to recognise that there are inequality issues in which men are the victims. For example: boys are falling behind girls in academic achievement; far less money is spent on combating ‘male’ than ‘female’ diseases (the difference between the amount of research into breast cancer and prostate cancer is a striking.) Last year, an oven cleaner ad drew a thousand-plus complaints for the slogan, “So easy, even a man can use it.” These can only be tackled by recognising that feminism has gone too far. The battle for equality is no longer needed but rather, we must remember feminism was never a tool for women to get their own back.\n",

The governing party then has a 5 year dictatorship. So far in our system with hung parliaments unusual and the governing party often getting massive majorities they can ignore all other opinion except the cabinet's. The government regularly survives back bench rebellions as well. This means they are not accountable to the people. The PM is only accountable to a small number of MPs who are strongly whipped to make sure they vote in the right way. In practice this means that the executive (PM + Cabinet) has as much power as many dictatorships, the 'absolute' monarchs of the past would love to have had parliaments that provide as little resistance as the Westminister Parliament does!\n",

            "[Doc 3280]: Many 'happy endings' in films leave me feeling sympathetic for the villain. I automatically look for their motive and find ways in which their actions aren't purely evil, and where the situation could have been resolved without killing them or completely wrecking their life's work. In films where 'the hero wins' and 'the villain loses', the morality is entirely bipolar, teaching children that some people are good and some people are evil and we shouldn't question this. This kind of thinking isn't what we need in a situation where it has already caused wars. In original versions of fairy tales, the morality is often quite complex, with main characters performing evil actions, the most unsympathetic people turning out not to be evil and nothing being as it seems. Fairy-tale magic isn't something 'good' or 'bad', its something untrustworthy, a bargain that you don't know the conditions of, with dire consequences if it isn't kept.\n",

Where they are not as in the case of Atatürk the man is mythologised in order to help show the unity of the nation and provide an example, an ideal if you will, for those who follow. Insulting this hero by deliberately publicising their dark side is therefore damaging not just for the state but for those who believe in the in the role model that the hero provides. In a country like Turkey where the focus of history teaching is on political citizenship education based upon national history everyone in Turkey learns about Atatürk. The aim is to educate pupils “As future citizens who respect the principles and reforms of Atatürk and democracy; who care for their families, country and the nation; who are aware of their responsibilities towards the Republic of Turkey; who work for promoting their families, country and the nation.”  So any attack will be damaging one of the role models for Turks young and old.\n",

For example, two post-9/11 studies found that subjects in a group that had a higher awareness of death favored a political candidate who was perceived as a savior and who preferred an aggressive strategy against their enemies over one who opted for diplomacy. Additionally, dictators like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Saddam Hussein, to name just a few, rose to power by exploiting people’s fears. When gripped by fear, whether real or imagined, it can slow or disrupt people’s rationale and abilities to make cognitive decisions.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1021]: In 2008 and 2012, Obama won more female votes than any of his predecessors. Through the (now defunct) White House Council on Women and Girls and increased enforceability of laws designed to combat pay discrimination, Obama’s administration directed efforts to ensure that American women could achieve financial independence. Higher minimum wages meant mothers could spend more time with their children; paid family leave would allow parents to parent without curbing their careers and ultimately, their spending power. Linking gender equality to America’s economic prosperity helped Obama to co-opt bipartisan support for a number of women’s issues. Despite Obama’s leaving office, women’s issues have had tremendous staying power; his legacy gave rise to powerful movements like #MeToo and Time’s Up, which continue to strongly advocate for women.\n",
            "[Doc 267]: Obama’s watershed victories on environmental protections, health care, equality, reproductive rights and financial reform were, in large part, accomplished through executive power – by issuing executive orders and regulations. Besides making it exceedingly easy for successors to simply “ tear up ” these laws, another unappealing side effect of Obama’s executive bulldozing is that it invites his successors to do the same. Take the Iran nuclear deal , which was signed by the US at the tail end of Obama’s presidency, yet has now been made a memory thanks to President Trump’s recent exit from the deal. The Paris climate change agreement is now as good as gone , as is the order that allowed transgender troops to serve in the military. This executive-heavy method of running the country dragged the government further into partisan politics and turned the presidency from an office of public service to the service of the president’s individual agenda.\n",
            "[Doc 1337]: One of the most fundamental principles of economics is that of supply and demand. By artificially reducing the supply (of hours) then demand must increase for other labour, ceteris paribus. The only question once that is realised is what limit should there be on working hours to ensure full employment. The purpose of the economy is to serve people, and having a large percentage of people excluded when there is an easy and obvious fix is to fail in the economies mission.\n",
            "[Doc 871]: Obama’s politics – and even his attitude – offered little in the way of national consolidation. He delivered character attacks to political opponents, insisting their positions were based in ignorance or indecency . At the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, Obama mocked not only political opponents but also individual citizens in a joke about an Indiana restaurant’s wish to not cater homosexual weddings. However laudable the affirmation of equal rights that spurred Obama’s jest, it is inappropriate for the POTUS to express those beliefs at the expense of small business owners (their pizza parlor eventually closed) who merely expressed their support of a law that reflected their politics. If the situation were reversed, would Democrats be expected to allow a right-wing, Christian president to make jokes about transgendered people who want to use a bathroom that matches their gender identity?\n",
            "[Doc 1627]: Domestic intelligence services are the only organization that is capable of performing counterintelligence. They have the capacity and the authority to detect foreign spies in the national jurisdiction, and experience with local surveillance and investigation. Part of the job of domestic intelligence is to maintain a network of informers and agents, and this can be used to find and track foreign intelligence services on a mission – these functions can’t be easily performed by the military or foreign intelligence so an independent domestic intelligence agency is necessary.\n",
            "[Doc 1759]: Mercenaries often arouse less hostility amongst civilians than soldiers fighting for national armies. In ethnic conflict they are perceived as less partisan. The fact that civilians to some extent do not connect mercenaries with a particular ideological cause, invasion or civil war makes them ideal for protecting safe areas and policing reconstruction projects. For example, PMC Global Risk Strategies successfully guarded the Green Zone in Baghdad, the sealed off section inhabited by coalition staff. As they are mercenaries they can be fighting for the national or local government of where their mission even if they have a different paymaster.\n",
            "[Doc 823]: Nowhere is Obama’s lack of cohesive international policy felt more profoundly than in Syria. In 2011, Obama walked back from his now infamous “red line” on chemical weapons, and decided not to directly intervene in Syria; a year later, a sarin gas attack by Syrian forces killed 1400 innocents. Failure to provide deterrence emboldened not only the Assad regime (leading to over half a million deaths and the century’s largest refugee crisis) but Putin as well, who found little opposition to his illegal annexation of the Ukraine’s Crimea region. With Russia unchecked, Iran has already expanded its regional influence . While refusal to supply political clout to pressing world issues undermined American international supremacy, more shocking was how Obama’s policy of non-intervention ran counter to his many bold appeals to human rights, casting doubt that his statements were little more than abstract niceties that he never intended to defend.\n",
            "[Doc 941]: From the invasion of Hawaii in 1893 to the bombing of Syria in 2017 , it is the norm for US intervention to be justified on humanitarian grounds. In some cases, this may truly be the motive. Case in point, punishing the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons against civilians. But rarely does military action improve the lives of ordinary citizens. The US mission in Libya was aimed at stopping a government-led massacre of its citizens. It may have done that, but Gaddafi’s death in 2011 led to civil war and chaos in the country, with ISIS gaining a foothold. Post-occupation Iraq looks no better, and Afghanistan remains at the mercy of the Taliban , more than 20 years after the 2001 US invasion. And if we go back a generation, wars in Southeast Asia devastated the region while bringing little benefit to its people.\n",
            "[Doc 1131]: Barack Obama’s presidency witnessed significant strides toward a more multicultural America that celebrates diversity. Top policy positions went to people of all colors, classes and creeds. Obama appointed more female and ethnically diverse judges than any president in history, including the Supreme Court’s first Latina Judge. He was the first president to introduce Hindu customs into the White House, or to wish Persian Americans a happy new year in Farsi. He also strengthened LGTB rights , paving the way for marriage equality and anti-discrimination legislation. No president better reflected America’s diversity, or honored it so single-mindedly as he.\n",
            "[Doc 1902]: Many people, especially those who belong to religious groups believe that we have a duty to preserve our own lives. They would argue that suicide is never justified, even if the reasons might appear to be good. It is impossible to sacrifice your life for others, because you cannot know how important your life is to others in relation to how important other people’s lives are. Either life is invaluable and it is thus impossible to value one life higher than others, or it can be valued, but it is impossible for us to assess our life’s value in relation to others. Therefore, while we accept that some might die, it is not for the individual to take matters into his or her own hands and accelerate the process, as this decision might be made on the wrong grounds, but cannot be reversed.\n",
            "[Doc 33]: Columbus’s accomplishments were not owing to his capabilities but to his penchant for ineptitude and miscalculation . Columbus’s initial mission was to discover an express route to Asia via the Atlantic. For reasons which are obvious today, Columbus never did discover such a route, nor did he discover the gold, gems, or spices that he’d promised in abundance to his Spanish patrons. He had no talent for geography . Columbus insisted Cuba was Japan and then China . He was convinced that the Bahamas were islands off the coast of India (hence, the geographical misnomer “West Indies”). Even his first colony was established by default when he was forced to leave behind castaway crewmen from his wrecked flagship Santa Maria .\n",
            "[Doc 316]: In 2003, American forces overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq and began an eight-year occupation. That war alone cost the US more than $2 trillion and the lives of nearly 4,500 American soldiers. It’s been estimated that America’s post-9/11 wars and military action in the Middle East and Asia totaled $8 trillion and killed more than 900,000 people. The two-decade-long Afghanistan war alone cost an estimated $300M a day . Though the US is capable of defeating any enemy, the cost of doing so in both human lives and money is usually far greater than anticipated. Wars like Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam , the latter of which saw nearly 60,000 American soldiers killed, are a case in point. But even smaller-scale interventions, like President Clinton’s 1993 mission in Somalia or the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011, had unintended consequences . When core US interests, such as the security of its citizens, are at stake, Americans may have no choice but to bear these consequences. But more often, the consequences of military action outweigh the benefits.\n",
            "[Doc 986]: When Greenspan left the Fed in 2006, two Princeton economists noted that he “has a legitimate claim to being the greatest central banker that has ever lived.” The financial crisis understandably led to a re-evaluation of this legacy, but what Greenspan accomplished during his term should not be overlooked. Greenspan saw two recessions during nearly two decades. These bookended the longest expansion in US history, as the country saw 10 years of GDP growth. From 1992 to 1999, the economy grew an average of 4 percent per year , a rate unseen in the post-Greenspan era. Greenspan was also a steady hand through two Gulf Wars and 9/11. The financial crisis must be factored into any evaluation of Alan Greenspan’s accomplishments but should not overshadow all else.\n",
            "[Doc 48]: The UN promotes and fights for human rights globally, yet these rights continue to be violated by many countries. It’s not the UN’s fault that international human rights are trampled on, but the organization seems powerless to stop it. Take the genocide in Rwanda , where the UN had an “Assistance Mission” established in 1994. Its members were aware of the impending genocide, but UN peacekeepers failed to stop the majority Hutus from murdering almost a million minority Tutsis. Another example is the 2005 rape and sexual abuse against Congolese children, perpetuated by UN peacekeepers themselves. Subsequent reports found similar allegations in other countries. Most recently, the UN and its UN Women organization have been called out for ignoring and/or denying Hamas members’ brutal and systemic rape of Israeli women on Oct. 7, 2023. If the UN doesn’t speak out against such human rights violations, what’s its purpose for existing?\n",
            "[Doc 1442]: It is extremely difficult to tell if someone is a genuine asylum seeker or not; for obvious reasons many will have little or no documentation, and all the evidence that they have suffered persecution may be in a faraway country and impossible to obtain. In many cases it may be impossible to prove that the person claiming asylum is even from the country that they claim to be from. Asylum decisions are therefore based largely on a judgement call by the investigating officer on whether they thing the person in front of them is being truthful or not – that leaves the system open to motivated people who are economic migrants or may even pose a security threat.\n",
            "[Doc 583]: Despite its noble mission, the deployment of 125,000 peacekeepers in troubled nations has sometimes caused unintended negative side effects on host societies. Take peacekeepers fathering and abandoning babies : There is no exact number of abandoned children known, (a dozen paternity claims were received in 2014), but the phenomenon motivated the United Nations to initiate a DNA collection protocol. Also, the world’s most recent outbreak of cholera in 2010, after an earthquake rocked Haiti, points to the UN. Genome testing demonstrated that the source of the plague, which infected over one million people and killed 10,000, was most likely a Nepali UN peacekeeping force. A UN- appointed panel of experts found that the cholera strain diagnosed in Haiti was “a perfect match” for a strain found in Nepal. Nepalese peacekeepers were staying at the UN camp in Haiti during the earthquake, and poor sanitation flooded local waterways with sewage from the camp. Such unintended consequences show that the UN has done more harm than good in parts of the world it has tried to help.\n",

These include the Fox Chariman Rupert Murdoch and several commentators’ privately rejecting election conspiracy theories even while promoting them online, since-retracted claims calling the coronavirus a Democratic-backed impeachment scam , and bogus accusations that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya . Perhaps more damaging is the reflexive partisanship, which in recent years manifested itself in a constant criticism of Obama and seemingly uncritical defense of former President Trump. Plus, the former president’s hiring in the summer of 2018 of former Fox executive Bill Shine to head White House communications strengthened the perception that the network and Republican party were closely linked.

And from then on, the Obama presidency struggled under a radicalized Republican Party. Coleman notes, “In the summer of 2012, under pressure from party activists to show some effort on immigration reform before the November election and unable to rise above the partisanship that dominated Washington as he had hoped, President Obama turned to his executive powers and announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.” But again we see the weakness of executive action.\n",

That America's first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 317]: The U.S. Constitution aims to shape the American nation and give it character. It is the everlasting and timeless written spirit of the United States. Let’s look at the Founding Fathers, however questionable their personal lives and decisions were back then regarding racism. Did they think that racism should be included in the Constitution? It’s fairly evident that the answer is no. The First Amendment is not about speech, it is meant to ensure that those inhabiting America are safe and can express themselves as they see fit, which the Biden administration is advocating through its United We Stand Summit , which aims to work toward preventing and/or countering the effects of hate-fueled violence in society. American ethos is that of a melting pot; being multiracial is one of its core features. As such, all members of American society should be protected by the First Amendment – and safe from hate.\n",
            "[Doc 1484]: Hate crimes should be given a more severe penalty because the harm done to the victim and society is greater. Given that the intent of hate crimes is more malicious than simple premeditative murder; it is just to enhance hate crime laws to reflect stronger punishment. Hate crimes don't merely victimize the individual upon whom violence is inflicted, they also victimize a community or minority group that the hate crime was intended to terrorize. This is why hate crimes frequently include highly public acts such as lynchings in town squares, dragging hate crime victims behind cars along streets inhabited by certain communities, and graffiti on significant buildings -they are intended to send a message. Hate crime-delivered messages limit the freedom of expression and group association of the victim community, thus violating their liberties. For this reason, hate crimes have more victims than other crimes, and subsequently deserver greater punishment. Moreover, as hate crimes are generally perpetrated against minority groups, and because these minority groups are always in a state of social disenfranchisement; it could be argued that hate crime enhancements are the state's way of attempting to arbitrate equality to minorities by compensating them with laws that will better favour their interests, thus forcibly \"balancing the scale\" of social equity.\n",
            "[Doc 1122]: True, tattoos are pretty common – and commonly accepted – these days. And while attitudes toward them are more lenient in the workplace than they were in the past, there are still prejudices that can affect one’s job prospects in certain places of employment. One survey found that 75% of the 2,675 respondents felt that tattoos hurt an applicant’s chances of being hired while 39% felt that employees with tattoos reflected poorly on the employer. And some tattooed employees may face company dress-code policies that make them cover up visible body art. For them, claiming their First Amendment Right to free speech won’t help them win any cases against employers. This is because the First Amendment only prevents governments from abridging someone’s freedom of speech and expression; it does not extend to private employers and certainly not to their prejudices.\n",
            "[Doc 2722]: You cannot fight racism, with more racism. You lose the moral high ground. You can call it all sorts of fancy names like \"positive\" discrimination, but at the end of the day, it's still racism based on race discrimination.\n",
            "[Doc 798]: Those who commit criminal acts are tried and sentenced. It goes without saying that those who commit hateful and racist acts or articulate slurs should be penalized as well. Hate speech is violent by nature and can cause direct and indirect physical and psychological harm. Professor Lisa Feldman Barrett of Northeastern University took a scientific approach to understand how hate speech affects the human brain. She explained that “if words can cause stress, and if prolonged stress can cause physical harm, then certain types of speech can be a form of violence.” Words also create an atmosphere that incites physical harm, as evidenced in the systematic murdering of millions at the hands of the Nazis, made possible after propaganda laid the groundwork for hate. Some offensive remarks may seem harmless, but they can snowball into more volatile forms. Once speech reaches an extreme, it becomes too late to avoid its dangerous consequences.\n",
            "[Doc 1485]: The additional punishment given to hate crimes under enhancements can help deter people who hold hateful views from acting on them, as they fear going to prison for any amount of time, and so any additional punishment affects their risk calculation before they commit a hate crime. Moreover, increased punishments help prevent those who have perpetrated hate crimes from re-offending through rehabilitation in prison. In cases of crimes motivated by deep hatred, rehabilitation may require increased time and increased effort in order to provide criminals with the correct focus and concentration, and a longer sentence is necessary for this to happen. Hate is not an essential human trait, we are not born hating people, it is a learned factor that can be unlearned when correctly rehabilitated. Therefore hate crime enhancements are just because they help prevent hate crimes and help prevent hate crime recidivism.\n",
            "[Doc 1511]: Students need to be able to take chances and express unpopular ideas in order to maximize their personal growth and development. Speech codes, even ones designed to only censor hate speech, have a chilling effect on all speech as students become afraid to say anything that is not politically correct. For example a student at California Polytechnic State University underwent a day long disciplinary hearing for posting a flyer publicising a talk “It’s O.K. to Leave the Plantation”. Students also need to learn to respond to ideas they don’t like because even if censorship of hate speech is effectively controlled on campus, it still exists in the outside world. Students will only be able to maximize their ability to ask questions, state opinions, and respond to ideas on a free campus.\n",
            "[Doc 1723]: We already set boundaries on what constitutes ‘free speech’ within our society. For example, we often endorse a ‘balancing act’  – other peoples’ right not to be abused. In this case, if an individual expresses abuse towards another – especially racism - they may be deemed to be outside of the boundaries or free speech and can be punished for it. This motion is simply an extension of this principle; the kinds of sites which would be banned are those which perpetuate hatred or attack other groups in society, an so already fall outside of the protection of free speech. The harms that stem from these kinds of sites outweigh any potential harm from limiting speech in a small number of cases.\n",
            "[Doc 266]: If all speech is protected by the First Amendment, then there is less room for government restrictions. On the other hand, if we allow the government to regulate free speech, then we open the door for greater government involvement in every aspect of our lives. This, much like McCarthyism , which sought to eradicate values viewed as a threat to the American way of life, would wind up as a grandiose witch hunt and would likely hurt America in the long run. Moreover, democracy is not measured by its mainstream, law-abiding citizens. Democracy allows people to go out against its modes and norms. When we shut down what we are not comfortable hearing, that’s a dictatorship .\n",
            "[Doc 800]: Contrary to popular belief, Muslim women in the West and the East alike (Saudi Arabia and Iran notwithstanding) choose the veil as a religious prerogative. The rights to religious freedom and the freedom of expression are enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution , which promises “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .” The Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School points out that the amendment protects “ actions taken upon behalf of [religious] beliefs ” – which necessarily, includes clothing. Just as we would not restrict a person’s right to proclaim their faith in Jesus by wearing a cross, so too should Muslims be allowed to express their faith through dress.\n",
            "[Doc 930]: Gun control proponents aren’t interested in taking away citizens’ guns. They cheer the Second Amendment , which states: “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” They support the Supreme Court 2008 decision , which validates the interpretation of the amendment that protects an individual’s right to own a firearm unrelated to serving in a militia, and to use that arm for lawful purposes, such as self-defense within one’s home. But this same Supreme Court decision also emphasizes that, in former Justice Antonin Scalia’s words: The Second Amendment is “not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for any purpose whatsoever.” Regulating deadly machinery (as we do with cars) is not about denying access but about oversight in the interest of safety for the community at large.\n",
            "[Doc 3371]: Imposing an age restriction for instance would be impossible to police. Only a full ban would be able to protect children from music that glorifies crime. We would never dream of only placing a partial ban on inciting racism for instance, because we know it is incorrect in any situation to glorify racism. Isn't murder, rape and theft equal if not more vile than racism? The prospect that anybody, regardless of age, could be influenced to commit such atrocities is morally reprehensible.\n",
            "[Doc 1483]: Hate crimes are crimes that are based on an idea that the perpetrator had prior to the crime. The crime itself is no different from any other crime except that it is punished more harshly. Because we are punishing an idea. All forms of violent crime, whether they are murders, rapes, or beatings are an expression of hatred toward another human being. To add more punishment to a crime because it represents a particular kind of hate (an idea) is to unfairly distinguish between different violent acts and trivialize those violent acts that do not appear to be motivated by prejudice hate. This is unjust because the idea itself does not cause harm, and is in fact legal in most cases (with the exception of direct incitement to violence), as racist or prejudiced statements and ideas are not illegal in most western liberal democracies. We allow extreme and prejudiced ideas to be legal because we recognise the value of free speech and open discourse in debating and discussing ideas, so as to best allow for progress in human thought. Hate crime enhancements constitute an attack on this as they make an individual liable for harsher punishments for his actions if he holds certain views, and thus the law unfairly discriminates against these particular viewpoints and not against others, and so hate crime enhancements are unjust.\n",
            "[Doc 1507]: While hate speech is a form of expression, it is not one that encourages dialogue. By promoting hatred based on immutable personal characteristics it is by definition anti-dialogue. Hate speech does not contribute anything; it merely provides a justification for violence and discrimination. Extreme messages, be they in words or through symbols, deter moderates from voicing their opinions, either because they do not want to legitimize the message or out of fear of reprisals. This reduces the net dialogue on university campuses and injures the quality of the dialogue that remains.\n",
            "[Doc 868]: When we think of dolls, the first brand to come to mind is most likely Barbie. Now think of mobile phones, did you think of Apple first? And what about soft drinks and fast food? Chances are high that Coca-Cola and McDonald’s first came to mind. Brand association is a big thing. There is a strong correlation between brand awareness and association and purchase decisions. By being the first brand to sell a product, if done right, you can make your brand name almost synonymous with the type of product (Kleenex or Band-Aid anyone?). The media is also more likely to cover a “first of” than a “slightly better” version.\n",
            "[Doc 1506]: Hate speech poses a clear danger to students and other members of the campus community. Often, the hatred is directed towards minority groups that are easily identifiable based on skin colour, clothing, or behaviour. Because these minorities are easy to identify, they can be targeted by those swayed by the speaker’s message. Every hate crime is a tragedy and an attack against the principles of WLDs. Even when the message doesn’t provoke violence, it can have a deep emotional harm on members of the targeted community. As such, the government has a duty to intervene to ensure that individuals are safe.\n",
            "[Doc 1605]: Freedom of speech certainly may be curtailed when real harms can be shown to arise from it. Extremist sites serve as centers of dangerous dissent, whose members threaten all of society. They promote a message that is fundamentally bad speech, because it cannot it cannot be argued with and promotes aims that are so anathema to free society that its dissemination represents a true threat to people’s safety. The threat extremists represent to free society demands that their right to speech online be curtailed. Thus, there is essentially no real loss of valuable speech in censoring extremist websites.\n",
            "[Doc 608]: The First Amendment, as it is understood today, protects people’s right to say what they want , not do what they want. Free speech does not absolve people from responsibility for their actions. Aristotle believed that the law binds men together into a “cohesive and just community.” However, in today’s more Libertarian America, the law must be upheld as is to keep minimal order, without inciting more hatred and aggression. It is not unthinkable to assume that banning some voices by law would just make those voices fester in darkness, rather than disappear. Every action has a reaction, and excluding extreme voices might push people to a bigger clash than the one we are seeing.\n",
            "[Doc 1608]: No matter how distasteful, or extreme, their opinions may be, everyone should have the right to voice them freely and publicly. That is the very essence of a free society. When groups presume to judge good speech from bad, and to shut off the channel by which the designated bad speech may flow, it abrogates its duty to protect the rights of all. When ISPs do this, which they do when they block sites they designate as extremist, they rob the people of their fundamental role as the final arbiters of acceptable speech in the marketplace of ideas, taking that power unto themselves without any form of democratic or moral mandate. Such a state of affairs is anathema to the continuation of a free society.

            "[Doc 1314]: It is paid for by the people through their taxes. The military is composed of the people through conscription. And as a result what it does is in the name of the people. The accountability of the instruments of the state, including the military, is at the core of what it means to be a democracy. It is therefore essential that the people know what it is doing in their name. Many democracies have laws giving a “right to know” for example the United State’s Freedom of Information Act and First Amendment right of access. In this case the military was exposed doing something it has been specifically ordered not to do by the courts so exposing a military that was disobeying civilian authority.\n",

The First Amendment, like the rest of the Bill of Rights, originally restricted only what the federal government may do and did not bind the states. In 1868, however, the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution, and it prohibited states from denying people “liberty” without “due process.” Since then the U.S. Supreme Court has gradually used the due process clause to apply most of the Bill of Rights to state governments.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 820]: Protests are not merely coalitions of the aggrieved but can be understood as an expression of a shared fate. Protests like the Women’s March on Washington as well as Parkland high schoolers against gun violence and pro-immigration protests saw participation of individuals who are unaffected by the core grievances of women, victims of school shootings and immigrants. Why? Because people’s identities are governed as much by their values as they are by their color, class, age and education. Case in point: The 2019 protests in Hong Kong against China’s encroaching influence inspired solidarity protests in the United States and elsewhere around the world. More recently, people of all races, colors and religions protested across America and the world against police brutality. Protests offer the opportunities to use values as their main identifiers, allowing for greater identification across diverse groups and intersectionality .\n",
            "[Doc 967]: Protests aren’t as effective as demonstrators like to think. Thousands of protests are constantly taking place around the world, and most of them pass without remark, revealing the miniscule impact of protests in general. Though the mob of pro-Trump protestors that stormed the US Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results drew the world’s attention (and condemnation ), it did not succeed in meeting its aims; the constitutional ceremony to certify the election results was interrupted, but Joe Biden’s presidential victory was confirmed . A Princeton study found that public opinion hardly comes to bear on legislation, and the results of most protests confirms this. The anti-war movement against US military involvement in Vietnam that was popularized on college campuses in 1965 had no effect on war activities, which were in fact ramped up until the war’s end in 1973. Protests in the US and the UK against the Iraq war did nothing to curb the invasion. Time will tell if the pro-Palestinian protests erupting across university campuses in the US and Europe will achieve anything politically impactful beyond disruptions to social order and academic life.\n",
            "[Doc 1300]: Anarchist groups may claim to contribute to political discussion and propose a viable alternative to states, but too regularly they contribute very little more than violence, they regularly hijack legitimate peaceful protests and by acting in a violent way detract from those protests. People will not listen if the movement is associated with violence so anarchism will never have an opportunity to contribute while it practices violence.\n",
            "[Doc 796]: Protests have been shown to exert influence over politics. Serbians ousted a dictator through nonviolent resistance, and Egyptians followed in kind ten years later. In 2017, grassroots protests that sprung up at American airports in reaction to Trump’s 2017 executive order barring refugees and citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. These protests could be credited for prompting swift legal action that allowed many visa-holders to remain in the country. In 2018, teachers throughout West Virginia went on strike during a nine-day protest that resulted in a 5% increase in pay – not to mention it inspired additional teacher strikes in other states. And the teenage survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in 2018 created a national discussion and movement that held government officials and businesses accountable and resulted in states passing 50 new gun-control laws.\n",
            "[Doc 983]: Dr. Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech bookended the Civil Rights Movement ’s march on Washington, yet the march itself cannot be credited for the civil rights legislation that followed it. Protest was just one part of a layered nonviolent resistance tactic employed by the movement for a decade before any legislation was signed. Protests can win exposure for a cause, but they do not fight legal battles that make change possible. Look at Roe. V. Wade. Though protests erupted across America when a leaked draft suggested that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, they didn’t help. Neither did the protests that swept the country after the court overturned Roe v. Wade . Since then, around 24 states have succeed to nevertheless banned abortion.\n",
            "[Doc 1087]: Throughout history, coal miners have been unlikely champions of protest movements. As global economies began shifting away from coal, miners suffered from downsizing, colliery closures, and loss of benefits. In the US and UK , miners used protests to bring their struggles to the public – and won. In 2016, coal workers of the China’s Longmay coal firm prompted the government to admit financial struggles and demand back payment of thousands of workers. Additionally, the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement was similarly effective in giving America’s lower income bracket a voice, shedding light on the growing chasm between the top 1% of American earners and the rest of the nation. More recently, the nationwide protests across America in response to the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer have brought police brutality and racism into the spotlight, forcing Americans to address the ongoing disparate treatment of African Americans , especially by law enforcement, which has been unchecked for decades. Unintentionally, the Black Lives Matter protests sparked a global reckoning with racism.\n",

            "[Doc 3754]: I think online classes are great. In my opinion it teaches people (mostly kids) responsibility by making them get up and take the initiative to go online and do the work without people having to remind or be on them for it.

You can still work and then come online and do your work and if you happen to finish early you can actually leave unlike in a real class.\n",
            "[Doc 3874]: Yes homework needs to have a limit because the children do have lives and don't do work all the time. They come home and they do chores for their parents. They go to parties and family affairs and maybe even host their own. Some might be in sport leagues and will be very busy and they might have clubs. So they might not have enough time to work on their homework. Also if they do, they will spend at least a little bit of it in enjoyment. I mean, everyone does this. Even the teachers who assign the homework. We all spend time enjoying ourselves once we come home after a long day of working. Therefore, the children might not have enough time to complete massive amounts of homework. Another point would be that, if the children have that much homework they will be extremely stressed with the stress of completing it and making sure it has good quality. This stress is definitely not good for their health, and in turn they might just give up. They just will go like i just can't do it and they won't do it. This would decrease their grades. if teachers give so much, they will get worse quality work and there would be less effort put in. So they might as well give less homework, so we will all do better and do our absolute best. All resulting in better quality work for in which both teacher and student will be happy about.\n",
            "[Doc 2272]: The main aim of education is to prepare us for the rest of lives. Homework is teaching us a key skill that we will need in the future. When we do homework we are learning to work on our own, the discipline to get the work done without the teacher’s prompting, and when we come up against difficulties we learn how to overcome them without our teacher’s help. Millions of people work for themselves (self-employed), or work from home, they are using exactly the same skills doing homework teaches us. This is not a waste of time.\n",
            "[Doc 2989]: The very fact that Maths is compulsory is causing it to be unpopular. People do not want to do what they are forced to do. People enjoy and wilfully enter into voluntary work but hate and dread their paid work, even when it largely involves performing the same tasks and one has the added incentive of pay, because they feel they have chosen to do the former while they are forced into the latter because of the need for money. Young people will do the compulsory subjects 'just because they have to', putting very little effort into them, while focussing their time on the topics that they choose to do. Making mathematics an optional subject will make it appear that it is the same as another GCSE, meaning that they will choose it because they are interested in mathematics, then be happy and motivated to study it.\n",

No matter what the intent, protest can take on many potential forms, often ranging from individual demonstrations to mass gatherings of people who assemble in support of a particular cause. Between March and April 1930, Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi carried out the Salt March, an influential act of nonviolent civil disobedience in protest of British rule in India. The three major forms of protest are civil disobedience, nonviolent protest, and violent protest. Acts of civil disobedience may be carried out by individuals or whole groups of protesters. Such protests often come in the form of demonstrations, marches, and vigils. When peaceful demonstrations fail to make an impact, violent protests sometimes become inevitable.\n",

Similar to past successful protest movements, demonstrators have expanded their efforts beyond political rallies to express broader discontent and participate in economic boycotts. To succeed in the long term, protest activities must have clear strategic objectives, broaden their coalitions, and develop concrete electoral and political mobilization efforts.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 873]: As the world’s only superpower, the US has a special role to play in setting the dos and don’ts of counterterrorism. When Americans use drones for targeting killings, other countries are likely to follow her lead. For example, China has weighed using drone strikes in Myanmar to deter illegal drug trade. With the definition of terrorist groups highly dependent on the goals of each individual government, it’s easy to imagine how drone warfare could devolve into a free-for-all. Another example: the use and availability of drones are increasing casualties and intensities of regional clashes in areas like Armenia and Azerbaijan that, until now, have been limited by such countries’ inability to wage air campaigns. On a larger scale, a 2022 deadly drone attack in the middle of Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels may mean an escalation of violence in an already volatile region. And let’s not forget about Syria, where the US and Russia are supporting opposing sides. US drone strikes (unintentionally?) hit a Russian-made tank as well as Russian military bases during previous defensive strikes against pro-Syrian forces. Who’s to say such drone strikes won’t lead to a tit-for-tat?\n",
            "[Doc 54]: The US’s drone campaign has been essential in the War on Terror. Drones proved adept in reaching the remote areas of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria, among other countries, where the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, among others, conducted (and still do) their terrorist activities. Daniel Blyman, a researcher with the Center for Middle East Policy, points out that drone strikes not only “defanged” al-Qaeda by neutralizing high-ranking combatants (and even the highest-ranking leaders, as was the case with Biden’s 2022 drone strike against Osama bin Laden’s predecessor, Ayman al-Zawahiri ), but also made it nearly impossible for them to train new combatants, convene, or use telecommunications of any kind. More than accomplishing American counterterrorism objectives, drone strikes are often the only defense local communities in tribal regions of countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have against terrorist groups that tyrannize them. For those who are regularly subjected to suicide bombings or whose children risk being abducted and taken to terrorist training camps, drone strikes provide a much-welcomed reprieve from terrorists’ violence. Not to mention, drone technology keeps advancing to make them even more efficient and effective: Take for instance just one development that allows operators to coordinate multiple drones simultaneously and overwhelm aggressors’ defensive capabilities.\n",
            "[Doc 782]: In Ukraine, drones are proving to a powerful weapon in their defense against Russia, without disruption without causing humanitarian damage . In general, drone strikes cost far less in human life than other kinds of warfare. This is owing to drone strikes’ precision. Whereas airplanes must quickly fire their weapons and depart the area, drones can hover above their targets for several hours, providing real-time surveillance that allows operators to detect non-combatants and wait for them to evacuate before firing. Additionally, drone weaponry is significantly smaller than those used in airstrikes. Their small blast radius safeguards against collateral damage, and they even have features that allow a misfire to be quickly corrected. A Slate report found that traditional forms of warfare, including airstrikes, missiles and ground operations kill around three times as many civilians as drone strikes.\n",
            "[Doc 418]: Drone attacks executed without the knowledge or permission of the country in which they are conducted violate that country’s sovereignty. One Afghani journalist decried the unilateral nature of drone attacks in Afghanistan, saying they undermined and destabilized the unity government, which the US itself had fought hard to help the Afghanis create. Similarly, in 2013, Pakistan’s prime minister repeatedly called upon Barak Obama to cease drone strikes there, citing the need for collaboration on security matters. Just as the United States would not tolerate any country operating on its soil without permission, the US should not expect such actions will be tolerated by other nations. Plus, the 2018 assassination attempt of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro involving drones carrying explosives goes to show how drones, in unrestrained hands, can increase instead of decrease geopolitical instability. While some say that drones are aiding the Ukrainians against the Russians, others argue that they are actually enabling the war to carry on.\n",
            "[Doc 441]: For those frustrated by the country’s military spending, drones are the answer. With a price tag in the hundreds of thousands to train one US Navy Seal, the US armed forces have a clear economic incentive (in addition to the moral one) to risk as few soldiers – not to mention civilians – as possible to accomplish the nation’s security goals. Remotely operated drone strikes preserve soldiers’ lives by removing them from the site of conflict, full stop. The Pentagon’s 2024 fiscal-year budget of $842 billion, the largest, nominal-dollar peacetime budget ever, includes spending requests for the procurement of 1000 drone wingmen to accompany combat aircraft. That’s already thousands of lives saved. Moreover, depending upon the type of drone, they can cost more than $18.5K per flight per hour, drones are still cheaper to build than bombers and far easier to maintain (and protect) than a standing army. Their lower costs and higher efficiency make them one of the most valuable tools in the military’s arsenal, and their use should be encouraged.\n",
            "[Doc 234]: Due process, or the right to a fair trial for the accused, is a cornerstone of the US Constitution and the bedrock of the American justice system. Any accused person on American territory, whether they are American or not , is protected by these laws. While drone strikes are conducted far away, location hardly negates the American imperative that all men are innocent until proven guilty. (The CIA counts any military-aged men in a strike zone as combatants). The American public would be outraged were any other government to kill an American on the mere presumption that he is a terrorist, without offering any proof. America should apply its own standards for justice abroad as it does at home, even if it’s impractical.\n",
            "[Doc 2431]: A study from the US Air Force’s School of Aerospace Medicine, Department of Neuropsychiatry, found that drone pilots, in addition to witnessing traumatic combat experiences, face several unique problems: lack of a clear demarcation between combat and personal/family life; extremely long hours with monotonous work and low staffing; \"existential conflict\" brought on by the guilt and remorse over being an \"aerial sniper\"; and social isolation during work, which could diminish unit cohesion and increase susceptibility to PTSD. According to a study of 709 drone pilots by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, approximately 8.2% reported at least one adverse mental health outcome, most commonly disorders related to adjusting to re-entry into civilian society, depression, and relationship problems.\n",

            "[Doc 948]: Unions may be well-intended, but their actions can hurt the general population. Most strikes, for example, negatively affect everybody – not just the people unions are trying to negotiate with. Teachers’ strikes, even over coronavirus safety concerns during the pandemic, still hurt children who were trying to learn and parents who needed to find last-minute arrangements for their kids; similarly, a health workers’ strike could potentially endanger the lives of the sick. It seems that this hurting of the general public is a tool that unions will use to get what they want. Moreover, union violence has been used in the past, such as in the Occupy Oakland strike of 2011, which culminated in violent riots that were later condoned by the US Supreme Court. Good intentions or not, public harm should not be an acceptable means for unions to achieve their goals.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",

            "[Doc 3995]: In contrast to other industries where there's no link between the safety of workers and the safety of users, on a bus everyone rides together and everyone shares the same roads with truckers. Many times the strikes happen because workers are demanding things that will make their work environment a safer one and since the environment is shared with the users the benefits affect them too. An example of such a strike happened in Belgium , where a trail accident caused workers to go on a strike that wasn't even sponsored by their Union. A strike can be a call for police supervision at nights to stop crime, more mandated sleep hours between shifts, maintenance on the vehicle breaks , etc) that benefit both groups. Everything from ergonomics to traffic can make the work of a bus driver high risk . Bettering working conditions in general prevents absenteeism, reduce stress in workers which in turn benefits the users. The short term harm of a strike pales in comparison to the improvement in service and safety felt by all. Also, outlawing unions/workers/people ability to bargain better conditions is a counterproductive way to achieve public well-being since society's collective bargaining is also affected. It's clear that transport workers are members of society and should be protected as such but if the government is allowed to ban strikes for that industry; there is nothing to stop it from doing the same to health workers or food industry workers, for instance.\n",

It is a matter of the upmost individual liberty that one’s thoughts and feelings are one’s own, and that individuals are free to express those thoughts and feelings openly.

Penalizing petty and non-violent crime with mandatory minimum sentences became the norm, as several states took inspiration from Clinton’s crime strategy. Over his tenure, the prison population doubled from 600,000 to 1.2 million people – an incredibly high human cost for an insufficient result .\n",
            "[Doc 1782]: Governor Romney would not scale back the War on Drugs, as he supports the punitive approach that characterizes drug policy in the status quo. Romney supports punitive strategies toward criminal justice in general, such as “three strikes and you’re out” laws, which impose mandatory sentences for people who have committed three offenses.

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful.\n",

The increasing adoption of drones has allowed non-state groups to engage more effectively with larger, more powerful states. While the use of drones by both state and non-state actors has risen, non-state actors have a much greater increase in adoption. Between 2018 and 2023, the number of states using drones rose from 16 to 40, a 150 per cent increase. However, over the same period the number of non-state groups who committed at least one drone attack rose from six to 91, an increase of over 1,400 per cent. As general drone use in conflict has risen, the number of drone strikes and fatalities has similarly increased. The most striking example of the use of drones by a state actor in the last year occurred in the conflict in Ukraine.\n",

In a recent study, we show that such approval is associated with higher public support and perceived legitimacy for a strike, which is cross-nationally consistent in France and the U.S. Variation in the use and constraint of drones suggests four patterns of strikes that are emerging globally. Fourth, countries can use drones *tactically* with *multilateral* constraint, adopting what we call juridical strikes. The treatment groups varied a fictional country’s drone strike in terms of use (tactical or strategic), constraint (unilateral or multilateral), and civilian casualty (yes or no). Sensitivity to civilian casualties also constitutes nearly 7.5% of French respondents’ perceptions for legitimate drone strikes. These findings have implications for French and U.S. strikes while also providing insights for countries’ evolving use of drones.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1082]: Thanks to economic sanctions and too much faith in oil, 13.5 million Russians are living below the poverty line. Yet Putin may be the richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of $200 billion to his name. What kind of leader is rolling in such dough when the people who follow him have trouble affording bread? Politically, Putin’s tactics to mitigate the opposition’s chances in municipal elections in Moscow in 2019 prompted allegations of him corrupting democracy . This corruption is seemingly nothing new for the leader. As a way to retain a tight grip on power, in 2021, Putin signed into law a controversial bill that allows for constitutional changes that may help him remain in power until 2036. Additionally, journalists have regularly been jailed to be silenced; under Putin, the press is anything but free.\n",
            "[Doc 3]: As a former member of the KGB, Putin still shrouds parts of himself in secrecy and has done a number of questionable-bordering-illicit things. Putin has faced evidence-based accusations of meddling in both the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. What’s more, he’s previously been voted “Person of the Year” by the Organized Crime and Corruption Project , due to his alleged engagement with the mafia to launder money and promote interests abroad . Additionally, suspicious deaths seem to happen to people who oppose Putin or try to expose political corruption. Prior to the recent death in an Arctic prison of opposition leader Alexei Navalny , others who have publicly criticized Putin for a myriad of reasons, ranging from corruption to Ukraine to his coronavirus response, have died of mysterious illnesses or by “accidental” falls from windows. A notable incident also occurred in 2018 that involved the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter, while both were in England. Though Putin denies any connection, such cases don’t make for a trustworthy resume. Nor do media reports assert that he’s not only aware of but lauds acts of torture being carried out at the hands of his soldiers in Ukraine.\n",
            "[Doc 665]: He comes from a humble, ordinary family and worked hard to get where he is, which may explain his appeal among his constituents. He has been voted into office as president again and again (and again, etc.) . Over the decades, he has won the majority of the votes in each of his five elections. Sure, talk of rigged voting permeates each election but the majority of Russians have maintained their support of Putin, even throughout the Ukraine war and whispers of foul play regarding his opposition . No matter what the world says and thinks of him, Putin remains stronger than ever domestically. He has managed to keep day-to-day life relatively unchanged for most of his countrymen even under the shadow of international sanctions. Similarly, 94% of Russians supported the 2014 annexation of Crimea. They also supported the war with Chechnya , which occurred when Putin was still establishing himself as president. His predecessor, Boris Yeltsin , once said that the public’s confidence in Putin is because “people believed that he, personally, could protect them.”\n",
            "[Doc 17]: While a powerful player in the world game, Putin is lacking when it comes to managing Russia’s current domestic affairs. For example, the current average life expectancy for men in Russia is around 72 years. While this is a record high , it fuels the need for more social protection for older adults. There is poor quality of air and water in many areas, hurting the overall health of the nation, with limited resources allocated to preventative healthcare. Also, the country’s economy is largely dependent on the price of oil – which is dangerous given the Biden administration’s 500+ sanctions in addition to the hundreds of other sanctions imposed on the country by the EU, UK and other countries, which are intended to curb its exports of oil and minerals in addition to freezing its currency reserves. While support for Putin may be high at home, it doesn’t mean he’s giving his people what they need.\n",
            "[Doc 1049]: It’s clear that Putin refuses to be bullied. He has repeatedly stood up to Western hegemony, as evidenced by his decision to invade Ukraine in response to recent and ongoing NATO expansion and, similarly, by his 2014 decision to annex Crimea , both against Western wishes. Even after being hit with economic sanctions, both back then and now, he won’t back down; international sanctions seem to fuel nationalistic pride . Even today, most Russians see the brutal war in Ukraine as a defense against the West. Putin is seen by his people as putting Russian interests at the forefront of his decisions, regardless of whom he aggravates in the process. Although it may be infuriating for other world powers, this refusal to be intimidated is an important quality for a country of millions to see in its leader, and it has, in the past, elevated Russia’s status in the world order.\n",

Putin stepped in , raised a shaky country off its feet, and got it to stand on solid ground. During his first two terms as president, Russia’s GDP increased by 70%, and investments rose by 125% . His many domestic reforms – such as tax cuts and expansion of property rights – further provided Russia with the stability it was looking for. Aside from giving his people someone to believe in, he made active changes that resulted in a much stronger, more secure country than it had been for decades.\n",

            "[Doc 2336]: Pussy Riot’s protest was politically focussed, the response seems politically driven and now they are prisoners. The name and chorus of the song performed was Virgin Mary, Chase Putin Out. Where any punishment required for this act – and Proposition contends that there was not – then it was at most a mild public order offence. Amnesty International and the overwhelming majority of the International media have reached that conclusion. The very fact that this has become a  cause celebre  shows the extent to which those who able to step back from the situation recognise this for what it is; a clear abuse of presidential power given the thinnest sheen of respectability by a compliant church. Such religious content as was contained in the protest fairly obviously relates to the setting and is not the main content of the song. It’s a fairly straightforward artistic device. It does, however, raise the question that if the intent of this song was to be blasphemous – a necessary component of proving it to be so – then why did they do such a bad job of it and spend so much their time going on about politics; it would suggest somewhat incompetent activists.\n",

There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 823]: Nowhere is Obama’s lack of cohesive international policy felt more profoundly than in Syria. In 2011, Obama walked back from his now infamous “red line” on chemical weapons, and decided not to directly intervene in Syria; a year later, a sarin gas attack by Syrian forces killed 1400 innocents. Failure to provide deterrence emboldened not only the Assad regime (leading to over half a million deaths and the century’s largest refugee crisis) but Putin as well, who found little opposition to his illegal annexation of the Ukraine’s Crimea region. With Russia unchecked, Iran has already expanded its regional influence . While refusal to supply political clout to pressing world issues undermined American international supremacy, more shocking was how Obama’s policy of non-intervention ran counter to his many bold appeals to human rights, casting doubt that his statements were little more than abstract niceties that he never intended to defend.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point?

These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",

But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted.

            "[150/185] Summarizing: The Perspective on Alan Greenspan\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 986]: When Greenspan left the Fed in 2006, two Princeton economists noted that he “has a legitimate claim to being the greatest central banker that has ever lived.” The financial crisis understandably led to a re-evaluation of this legacy, but what Greenspan accomplished during his term should not be overlooked. Greenspan saw two recessions during nearly two decades. These bookended the longest expansion in US history, as the country saw 10 years of GDP growth. From 1992 to 1999, the economy grew an average of 4 percent per year , a rate unseen in the post-Greenspan era. Greenspan was also a steady hand through two Gulf Wars and 9/11. The financial crisis must be factored into any evaluation of Alan Greenspan’s accomplishments but should not overshadow all else.\n",
            "[Doc 39]: On one item contributing to the Great Recession, Greenspan’s prescient warnings which could have prevented, or at least mitigated, the crisis were ignored. Greenspan spent the years before the crisis repeatedly warning that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored entities created by Congress to facilitate mortgage lending, had overstepped their mandate and were overleveraged, adding systemic risk to the housing market. He called for both GSEs to be more heavily regulated (which, it’s worth adding, goes against the claim that he had an ideological aversion to regulation). Much ink has been spilled debating whether Fannie and Freddie caused the 2008 financial crisis. Without venturing into that debate, it’s safe to say that, after the federal takeover of both organizations, Greenspan was on the right side of history on this issue.\n",
            "[Doc 136]: While Greenspan’s views may have evolved from his years as an Ayn Rand devotee, his faith in the self-regulating power of the markets stayed with him until the end, to the great detriment of the American economy. His support for deregulatory action helped pave the way for out-of-control speculation on Wall Street and, eventually, the 2008 financial crisis. One example of Greenspan’s deregulatory zeal is his role in weakening and eventually scrapping the Glass-Steagall act , which allowed “too big to fail” banks to get even bigger. And for years, he opposed efforts to regulate derivatives , which spun out of control in the leadup to the crisis. Greenspan himself said after the crisis that he made a mistake in presuming that the self-interest of organizations, specifically banks and others, were capable of protecting their own shareholders. Unfortunately, his realization came too late.\n",
            "[Doc 8]: The caricature of Greenspan as a Randian opposed to any and all regulation is greatly exaggerated . By the time he became Fed chairman, Greenspan was more nuanced in his views and open to reasonable regulations. He supported, for example, raising auditing standards after the Enron scandal, and in the words of his successor, Ben Bernanke , “rarely resisted regulatory initiatives put forth by the Federal Reserve Board staff.” His resistance to regulation of derivatizes and other financial innovations stemmed from his belief that they were useful in deconcentrating risk, which at the time was not a radical view. Even today, with the benefit of hindsight, top economic minds are unsure of the right levels of regulation. While Greenspan admitted his faith in regulation was tested by the crisis , the problem was not his dogmatism. It was the complexity of the challenges faced by the Fed during this period.\n",
            "[Doc 29]: When bankers and the systems that govern them are alerted to problems in their industry, they often look the other way. Brooksley Born , Chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1996-1999, rang the alarm bell loud and clear on the dangers of derivatives (the kind of speculative investments that drive pricing bubbles and precipitate financial crashes like the one that crippled the global economy in 2008) to then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who ignored her. Similarly, dozens of analysts alleged the unreasonably high returns produced by Madoff Investment Securities could only be the result of fraud, but the SEC ignored obvious indications of Madoff’s Ponzi scheme , which cost unsuspecting investors billions. Repeat instances of foul play quite rightfully raise public skepticism about the integrity of the entire finance industry.\n",
            "[Doc 508]: A related but separate criticism comes over Greenspan’s insistence on maintaining low interest rates throughout the 2000s. Greenspan followed conventional wisdom in keeping interest rates low after the dot-com bust and the September 11 attacks, a defensible decision. But he kept cutting rates for the next two years, even as the economy was out of the woods. The Federal Funds Rate dropped to a low of 1% in 2003 and did not begin the slow crawl back up until 2004. The low rates were a major contributor to the housing bubble. They helped heat up the economy, providing an initial boom but paving the way for eventual crisis.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 1190]: The overheated economy of the 2000s, though headed towards disaster, could have at least helped shore up the government’s balance sheet. The US had a significant budget surplus when President Bush took office in 2001. But the surplus was squandered on massive tax cuts. Greenspan had previously held that budget surpluses should be used first to pay down the national debt – which, at $5.8 trillion, was still imposing – before being spent on tax cuts. But the chairman shifted his stance to support the Bush plan, saying that there was enough money for both tax cuts and paying down the debt. History would prove that prediction tragically wrong.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 2937]: Even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity. There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much.

Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006.

On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: \"Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems.\" Despite this, Greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, \"History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums\" as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 758]: For a workaholic, working from home is roughly equivalent to conducting an AA meeting in a distillery – the tools to feed your addiction are precariously close by. And those who are not addicted to work still admit difficulties in setting boundaries between work time and personal time. Conversely, there are also telecommuters who are unable to snap out of “personal mode” when working from home. Those who dream of working in their pajamas often meet the fretful reality that they were about as productive in their waking hours as they were in their sleep. Working at home may actually make it harder to achieve a healthy work-life balance and, therefore, is simply not suitable to all personality types .\n",
            "[Doc 629]: For individuals, working from home means significant savings in transportation costs, like gas and automobile upkeep, and access to affordable (and arguably, healthier) food from their own kitchens. Not to mention, in times of global pandemics, working from home can turn into a protective measure . Time economy for telecommuters is also a distinct advantage – hours not spent commuting can be applied to work, household upkeep, or even exercise or sleep. Work-from-home opportunities increase overall household incomes by providing opportunities for individuals who are not able to arrive to traditional jobs , like parents with young children, retirees, and the disabled . Companies who employ telecommuters save money on real estate, utilities, training. Plus, work-from-home arrangements have even been proven to encourage employee retention . What’s more, a recent survey showed that 34% of US workers were willing to take a pay-cut of up to 5% just for the opportunity to work remotely.\n",
            "[Doc 2466]: We should also be protecting them from tyranny at home by standing up for their rights, including freedom of religion.\n",
            "[Doc 322]: Not all home environments are conducive to at-home learning. Level of education, time, and energy vary among parents, and parents at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum tend to have the least amount of each resource. Wealthier kids are more likely to benefit from homework simply because they have the necessary resources to complete it: adult assistance, home computers and internet access. However, students whose home situations may preclude them from completing homework (for example, older siblings who care for younger siblings or children who need to hold an after-school job) inevitably fall further behind . As such, homework can exacerbate achievement gaps between rich and poor students, rendering homework not only counterproductive, but a barrier to equality.\n",
            "[Doc 3714]: It is unlikely that refusal to display the religious text will result in the drastic action of parents withdrawing a child from school. Ultimately, parents have a right to home school or educate their children wherever they wish – if this means they exercise that option, then so be it. Much home schooling is dedicated and successful.\n",
            "[Doc 301]: If homeownership were merely about financial imperatives, there would probably be much fewer homeowners. But buying a home is much more than a financial transaction. Buying a home first and foremost answers the human desire for rootedness and continuity. Homes provide a space for families to grow, convene throughout large spans of time, and create memories. A home can house a family through several generations and is a natural nexus of intergenerational bonding . A house’s market value may rise and fall, but a home is truly priceless.\n",
            "[Doc 3441]: To go to a doctor to gain information that could be gained at home seems like a pointless venture. By testing at home for genetic susceptibility to medical conditions, this will better stretch doctors’ valuable time and resources to patients who are ill or who have already contracted such diseases. Furthermore, many people find a trip to the doctor a daunting experience, which they then try to avoid. Thus, medical conditions or potential to contract such conditions may go undetected. By offering home testing kits, this problem can be avoided as patients do not have to directly confront a doctor, learning about their health in the emotional comforts of their home.\n",
            "[Doc 3385]: Forced marriage is most commonly found in communities where is it more common to marry someone from 'back home'. Where one person in each generation comes from the 'home' culture, this is a barrier to integration and encourages segregation. As children tend to learn behavioural norms from their parents and other family members, if they see a person who is not engaged with wider society because of language, culture or any other reason, they will see a lack of engagement by one parent as the 'norm'.\n",
            "[Doc 935]: If you have it, home equity , gains from a home’s appreciation value minus monies owed, can be a powerful financial tool. Home equity loans and lines of credit can help to turn a fixed asset into a liquid one. This can be a godsend if you need quick cash for unexpected home or car repairs, or if you suddenly have a medical crisis. Home equity can also help homeowners to finance anticipated expenses like college tuition and vacations at significantly lower interest rates than those offered on student or personal loans. (Plus, the payments are tax deductible – woohoo!). And, homeownership can provide monthly dividends for those who decide to turn their homes into rentals . Even if you downsize to a smaller rental of your own, you’ll pocket the difference each month, which can help turn into savings or even an extra vacation.\n",
            "[Doc 3264]: Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 amended by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 employers must make all reasonable adjustments in order to facilitate the employment of a disabled person. Under s6(1)(b) this includes making necessary physical adjustments to the work space. If companies operated a work from home policy, they would not need to adapt the working office in order to accommodate disabled employees; instead they will just allow them to work from home. This will save the employers money as for some disabled people; the adjustments that would need to be made would be vast.\n",
            "[Doc 3710]: It's not all about letting your kids drink. It's about teaching your child at around the age of 17 to be responsible about it. Everyone knows that kids are going to drink especially when they reach college. It would be better for the kid to have some sort of introduction to it, or else they will go crazy with it and end up hurting them or others. If a parent strictly forbids it, the kid will rebel and find him or her self in situations where they cant get home safe so they drive themselves, unable to call a raging parent about drinking, for a ride home. \"Rebellion\" has been seen as the \"cool' thing for generations now. Letting teens think of drinking as a \"wrong\" thing will make them want to do it even more\n",
            "[Doc 138]: A big part of college is fostering a network that will be able to assist you socially as well as career-wise after graduation. This network needs to be nurtured and maintained, which becomes almost impossible while living abroad. New connections made are unlikely to be of use to a student looking for a job back home. Only the minority end up staying in the country they study in, making their network gained there less useful for the majority of students who return home.\n",
            "[Doc 2802]: Yes, i believe that people should be accountable for what they say or do if it's inappropriate. It is very unprofessional and it would cause a bad name for the company. As a professional employee we tend to forget that when we are employed we not only represent ourselves but we also represent the company and the employer. Also, professional employees need to remember that being professional means that in any situation it is not appropriate to say anything that would offend other employees or customers. Sometimes, employees take their personal lives to work and it sometimes cause problems to arise. There are employees who try to find other co-workers to confide in and it ends up leaking out to other co-workers and rumors spread and then problems occur. These are sometimes what causes people to say things that are wrong or shouldn't be said at all. Being humans, we tend to say things without thinking about it. Sometimes we think we are helping with the problem but we just end up making it worse. For example, from personal experience, Sam's Club is a really great place to work. You learn a lot from working there, at least i did from working in the jewelry department. But the big problem over there is people tend to get in trouble by saying things that are wrong. Like, spreading rumors about people or just saying something offending to a co-worker gets you in trouble. Especially if it deals with that persons race, religion, and anything that could offend that person. One of my co-workers was jokingly talking about the stereotypes of another country not knowing that the co-worker in the same room was from there and it offended her. The guy that made the joke got written up and got a warning. I honestly believe that it is wrong to say things that could be offending because everyone has feelings and if it's too the extreme of making someone not wanting to come back to work or something that would make the company's reputation bad then yes i believe that people should lose their jobs for it.\n",
            "[Doc 3937]: The internet is as everyone knows a network where you can meet people and interact. It is a commons area where which we are all free to use. Even in paid areas we should not expect more privacy then you would at for example a resturant or a club that you pay to get in to. While people may well be going online in their own home the internet is not like your home and is as such much more open and accesable to others. This means that everyone should be very careful about what information they hand out and where. You would be worried about leaving your passport or something else that has all your details on a bus so why should you not be worried about having those same details on social networks?\n",
            "[Doc 2799]: Gross misconduct is AP Business Solutions considered to be misconduct serious enough to destroy the contract between employer and employee and irretrievably break down the working relationship and trust between them . If an employee complains about their working conditions, how can the relationship continue as it was? How can there be any trust. If the employer knows that the employee is not happy, they will know that they are not working to their best level and will constantly be asking them to do more. This will heighten the troubled nature of the relationship and the employer should be able to sack the employee in respect of that.\n",
            "[Doc 3874]: Yes homework needs to have a limit because the children do have lives and don't do work all the time. They come home and they do chores for their parents. They go to parties and family affairs and maybe even host their own. Some might be in sport leagues and will be very busy and they might have clubs. So they might not have enough time to work on their homework. Also if they do, they will spend at least a little bit of it in enjoyment. I mean, everyone does this. Even the teachers who assign the homework. We all spend time enjoying ourselves once we come home after a long day of working. Therefore, the children might not have enough time to complete massive amounts of homework. Another point would be that, if the children have that much homework they will be extremely stressed with the stress of completing it and making sure it has good quality. This stress is definitely not good for their health, and in turn they might just give up. They just will go like i just can't do it and they won't do it. This would decrease their grades. if teachers give so much, they will get worse quality work and there would be less effort put in. So they might as well give less homework, so we will all do better and do our absolute best. All resulting in better quality work for in which both teacher and student will be happy about.\n",
            "[Doc 2269]: We all need some time to ourselves. School already takes up a lot of time and it is necessary to have time which does not involve concentrating on learning. Education is not the only important activity in everyone’s day; physical activity, play, and time with family are just as important as all teach life skills just in different ways. The internet makes it possible to be learning at home, there are even many computer games that help with learning. Homework clashes with these other activities. It can damage family relationships as it means parents have to try and make their children do their homework.\n",
            "[Doc 2946]: If people have earned money through working hard they have a right to spend it in whatever way they choose. Surely that includes passing it on to their children.\n",
            "[Doc 3919]: If more work was done in a structured environment built for working in, where you can get help with your work and you can work more intensively without distractions, you don't have to do as much homework. Then your home life is something separate from your study life, so you can concentrate on playing and family time.\n",
            "[Doc 2300]: Homework is a vital and valuable part of education. There are only a few hours in each school day – not enough time to cover properly all the subjects children need to study. Setting homework extends study beyond school hours, allowing a wider and deeper education. It also makes the best use of teachers, who can spend lesson time teaching rather than just supervising individual work that could be done at home. Education is about pushing boundaries, and the learning should not stop at the entrance to the classroom – students should take skills learnt in the classroom and apply them at home. Homework allows this to happen, encouraging students to go above and beyond what they do in school. Reading is the best example, students learn how to read at school, but in order to get better, they need to practise and that is best done at home, with the support of parents and at the right pace for the student.\n",

The data allowed us to track people over time and examine how their mental health changed alongside their commuting patterns and working from home arrangements. We focused on two things to see if there was any effect on mental health: commuting time and working from home. Working from home had a strong positive effect on women's mental health, but only in certain circumstances. Light or occasional working from home had no clear effect on women's mental health. Workers with poorer mental health are the most sensitive to long commutes and the most likely to benefit from substantial working from home arrangements.

To believe the individuals who make their claim in the favor of life on other planets would do you just as good to believe a car mechanic claiming he found a cure for cancer. No consistent proof exist, until then humans need to only to worry about the preservation of the only life know on any planet, our own and the sub species which we share the earth with.\n",
            "[Doc 2527]: Vegetarians mistakenly elevate the value of animal life over plant life. Research shows that plants respond electrochemically to threats and may feel fear,  so vegetarians are also causing harm every time they kill and eat a plant. Every organism on earth dies or is killed, at some point, so others organisms can live. There is nothing wrong with this cycle; it is how nature works.\n",

            "[Doc 1203]: Whether or not you believe a fetus is already a life, it is undeniable that once conception occurs, the potential for life exists . Life is our strongest biological and psychological instinct, serving as the foundation for Maslow’s hierarchy of needs . To many, in a world of uncertainties, the pursuit of life is the only definite. Many people may argue that putting a deliberate end to life goes against our biological and physical existence. Who are we to play God and decide what constitutes life or who deserves to live and die? Who are we to take charge of the future of a totally dependent unborn child and determine that his or her life is not worth living, no matter the circumstances?\n",
            "[Doc 3334]: The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like.” Hawking believes that alien life is almost certain to exist in many other parts of the universe due to the vast scale of the universe the earth is unlikely to be the only place where life evolved. although we have no idea where that might be. There is no saying that they will have evolved on planets like us so our current way of looking for life by looking for water could just be the starting point. They may live not just on planets, but perhaps in the centre of stars or even floating in interplanetary space. At the moment making contact is 'a little too risky'.\n",
            "[Doc 1909]: There exists a basic right to life which, as humans, we try to follow. Killing others is outlawed because we generally believe that every person has the right to live their life and no one else has the right to take that life away. In the situation with the train there are two possible outcomes which both lead to life being cut short. Due to the fact that we place such value on life we have a duty to reduce the number of people who die. One ought to commit the act that results in the fewest deaths, and this is to kill the one and save the five.\n",

            "[Doc 3822]: I think we should open our mind a little bit and think about what really makes the earth planet to have existing life? And what do we need to keep existing in our planet? Now let’s think the entire universe is huge and there are millions of galaxies with planets with the same or almost equal characteristics of the earth planet. Why we couldn’t accept life in other planets but only in this planet? And the other question is what makes us so special to be the unique species on this universe? The conception of life we have may be wrong in the concept that we need water and oxygen to survive, but for other kinds of life they may need different elements. written by martz642 just think about it for a second thing of a HUGE room like a stadiam, that stadiam is all of space. Now think of a single dust mote in that Stadiam. that dust mote is our entire solar system. Of which contain several planets in each one. There is already an estimated number of OVER 1,000,000 intelligent civilizations in just our Milky Way Galaxy!!! We just have to look hard enough. Hell, who knows, maybe they are watching us right now saying how stupid we are for fighting like wild animals. Because that is what we act like. To say that we are truly alone would be itiousy because that is not logical.\n",
            "[Doc 226]: By definition, death is the cessation of life – so, by all logic, there is no life after death. In this vein, physics professor Sean Carroll contends that life after death is impossible. While there are many things we don’t know about the world, he says, we do know about the particles that make up the human body – and those don’t go anywhere after the body dies. Because consciousness is part of the physical body, it dies along with the rest of a person. Unlike other uncertainties in life, this concept is relatively straightforward: With death, life ends.\n",
            "[Doc 2861]: Parents who surround their child with cotton wool and do not let them play outside are impeding a child’s fun. Childhood should not be merely about school work, family and chores. They need to be allowed the time to play outside, away from the watchful eye of adults. They need their break too. We are preventing children from doing what they naturally want to do if we prevent them from playing outside. Children long to be silly in open fields and to swing on swings and run around parks, this is the release they need. Without this measure of fun, they will be mundane children who turn into mundane adults.\n",
            "[Doc 1889]: Every life presents an inherent value to society. Every individual has the potential to contribute in one way or another, and taking the child's life before it has even had a chance to experience and contribute to the world undermines that potential. Even more, the underlying philosophical claim behind abortion is that not every life is equally valued and if a life is 'unwanted' or 'accidental' it is not worth enough to live. That kind of thinking goes directly against the life-affirming policies and philosophies of most countries, and peoples themselves.\n",
            "[Doc 249]: Earth’s booming population requires ever larger amounts of energy. As such, nuclear energy may well be the most efficient way to keep up with the demand. The energy released from nuclear fission is 50 million times more powerful than ordinary chemical reactions, like those produced by burning fossil fuels . The small amount of fuel required to produce vast amounts of energy not only keeps nuclear energy cheap, but it also means that the Earth’s uranium deposits can potentially power humanity for centuries (at current consumption rates).\n",
            "[Doc 1561]: The right to be forgotten is premised on the idea that internet requires additional rights beyond those in the real world. Offline there is no right to demand that people do not to talk about or show photos of your embarrassing moments. Provided that there is no privacy breach, once something is out in public, you cannot take it back. There is no rule enabling you to be forgotten in real life, even if things you have done harm you. Why then do rules have to be different for the internet? In 21st century the internet has become an integral part of our lives and of human communication that it is in fact just another reality for us. We do the same things there as we do in real life – socialise, engage in our hobbies etc. The only difference is that the internet provides us with greater opportunities, such as reaching more people, but that does not change the principle that human interaction online is pretty much the same as offline. If there is no right to be forgotten in real life, there should not be one in the digital one.\n",
            "[Doc 1902]: Many people, especially those who belong to religious groups believe that we have a duty to preserve our own lives. They would argue that suicide is never justified, even if the reasons might appear to be good. It is impossible to sacrifice your life for others, because you cannot know how important your life is to others in relation to how important other people’s lives are. Either life is invaluable and it is thus impossible to value one life higher than others, or it can be valued, but it is impossible for us to assess our life’s value in relation to others. Therefore, while we accept that some might die, it is not for the individual to take matters into his or her own hands and accelerate the process, as this decision might be made on the wrong grounds, but cannot be reversed.\n",

So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1064]: Attempts to regulate Bitcoin have been underway for a while. For example, the IRS treats Bitcoin as property and taxes it as such. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is both decentralized – meaning it has no central role of management or authority – and unstable. Some may see its decentralization as a good thing, but this opened it up for black market trading in the past. In fact, in 2016, over 10% of Bitcoin transactions happened on The Silk Road, a hidden online service (which is now defunct ) that allowed for trading drugs, illegal substances, and other illicit activities. In 2020, $1 billion in bitcoin was said to be linked Can we really allow ourselves to use Bitcoin if it might pave the way for criminal activity?\n",
            "[Doc 456]: As of now, Bitcoin has the potential to become an environmental disaster . While it may seem like it saves resources, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Tracker currently shows that Bitcoin consumes 146 .86 Terawatt hours per year, and that number is only going up. To put that in perspective, that’s comparable to the annual power consumption of Ukraine or the annual carbon footprint of Romania, and one Bitcoin transaction could cost as much water as a backyard swimming pool. Currently, the amount of energy it takes to “ mine ” (i.e., create) and use Bitcoin is unsustainable in the long term.\n",
            "[Doc 655]: Bitcoin is catching on, regardless of any personal aversion to it. It is already considered as one of the world’s top currencies and is becoming more and more mainstream; Elon Musk’s Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in 2021 while certain colleges even accept it as payment. In fact, there are reports that JPMorgan , among others on Wall Street, are accepting Bitcoin as an asset class. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve is reportedly creating a bank-to-bank digital currency, proving just how relevant Bitcoin already is to the future of currency.\n",
            "[Doc 719]: Many see the overall rise in Bitcoin prices as a bubble, due to its volatility . In finance terms, a “bubble” is when the price of an asset far surpasses its fundamental value, implying that its preliminary spike in value will eventually crash and burn. For example, in 2008, the U.S. housing bubble popped , leading to an economic crisis , which became the Great Recession. In this vein, whenever Bitcoin prices drop, experts warn that they will only continue to fall , especially in the long run, even after temporary recoveries. Also, Bitcoin takes money and power away from institutions that are used to being in charge – namely, banks and governments. It’s reasonable to assume that given all the revenues they stand to lose, they won’t take this lying down; they have all the resources in the world at their disposable to combat the success of virtual currency.\n",
            "[Doc 148]: Bitcoin has allowed people to put their trust in technology instead of third-party mediators like banks and civil-law notaries. This is because it relies on blockchain technology , which is a complex mathematical model that instantly creates a virtual chain of recorded transactions when Bitcoin is transferred from one place to another. These transactions are easily verifiable, and will eliminate the possibility of human error, steep transaction fees, and long wait times when transferring money. In other words, Bitcoin makes the whole process of using money more efficient by cutting out the middlemen who have had to oversee every transaction that takes place thus far. This is why mainstream payment firms like PayPal are not only investing in it but offering it as an option to their platform.\n",
            "[Doc 621]: Illustrious investor Warren Buffet has long warned people to “never invest in a business you cannot understand.” He has advised to only invest in companies that you already know about, which is difficult to do with small-change apps that often invest in companies of their choosing. Depending on apps to do your work for you may be advantageous in the beginning but will hinder you from learning the craft of investing long term and learning how to make real money by investing independently. When the time comes for you to invest more than just your spare change, how will you know with which investments to start? Practice makes perfect, and investment apps won’t give you that chance.\n",
            "[Doc 3375]: 'Theft by finding' implies that someone lost something and you found it and failed to return it. This isn't the case if someone threw something away. Tesco don't want the food back and have no intention of doing anything with it. If taking away rubbish was illegal, refuse disposal workers would be criminals. its like arresting a freakin mouse they are the ones who threw away their food so its not exactly theirs any more so how does it become theft when she took something that is free (i guess) damn i feel sorry for the innocent women who got arrested i mean come on for all we know she might be poor or something or starving you arrested someone who was trying to stay alieve wow that is ummm i dont know CONFUSING!\n",
            "[Doc 3376]: It is a waste for the supermarket to just throw the food away when someone else can eat it, and then not even let people take it away. Only the poorest and hungriest people would resort to scavenging from the back of a shop, they need the food the most and can't afford to buy it, so why not let them have the food? The food couldn't have been sold anyway, the shop can't stay open if it has no power and they couldn't have refrigerated the food, so they couldn't store it for long enough for someone to buy. If the shop actually had a plan to store it somewhere else and sell it at a reduced price or or give it to charity, that would be different, but they are just throwing thousands of pounds worth of food away. Such a policy would make the shop more popular in the long run.\n",
            "[Doc 929]: In addition to not requiring a lot of money, these apps also take away the technical and bureaucratic processes involved with investing. You don’t need a four-year degree in finance to invest successfully with small-change apps. Many people don’t have time to properly sit and study the market, which is why these user-friendly apps do the work for you. Apps like Stash do research on companies that support causes you believe in, categorizing them for you and making it easy to choose in what to invest. Additionally, you can make automatic payments through these apps, enabling investing without a second thought.\n",
            "[Doc 2274]: One way we learn is by repetition, another is by doing things, when doing homework we learn in both of these ways. When we are taught a method at school, such as how to do a type of sum, then we need to practice using that method to make sure we know how to so that we can remember it. If we just learn the method and don’t practice it we will soon forget how we do it.\n",
            "[Doc 3990]: Meat is not inherently wrong. It is something we as human's are designed to eat, we are Apex predators , top of the food chain, we are built to hunt and consume other animals. The arguments that meat is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly do not mean that we should not eat meat, it simply means that we should not eat as much. We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was. I do not believe that this was an immoral way of living, it is not about wether we shoudl eat meat it is about how we currently eat meat. We need to have an awarness of environmental harm and look at reducing it, we need to aknowledge animal cruelty and stop it, we need to farm and prodice efficiently but we do not need to stop eating meat.\n",
            "[Doc 2801]: While it is okay to voice out your own opinion, there should be a limit to whatever we say. Every opinion should not affect anyone else. Opinion that can cause blunder should be kept away from public.And since the employees knows more about the employer than the public does, it is considered professional to keep information of the company and employer to the employee himself or herself\n",
            "[Doc 2293]: Ensuring everyone gets educated for the same amount of time at school should promote equality. Currently early-school leaving is linked with other indicators of socio-economic disadvantage, such as low-income jobs or high unemployment. More importantly parents who left school young and as a consequence have lower-grade occupations are more likely to have children who leave school early (only 60% of those children stay in education past 16) . Forcing all children to stay in school longer could break this cycle of disadvantage.\n",
            "[Doc 2880]: Why should the army be allowed to market themselves to children who are too young to buy alcohol, cigarettes or drive when joining the army is more dangerous than these three things? If we protect our children from the harmful effects of drugs, we should be protecting them from getting shot as well. Allowing one and not the other is hypocrisy - and since letting 16 year olds drink legally would be a less-than-sensible idea, we should ban the armed forces from recruiting in schools.\n",
            "[Doc 3700]: They hold a privileged position in society as we need to protect them. Childhood is about having fun and we should promote that rather than putting responsibility onto children as to voting. Statistics show that children these days do suffer from feeling too pressured from school work , we should not add to this by allowing them to vote.\n",
            "[Doc 544]: “The other 99% ” (people who don’t fall into the wealth bracket of the rich) may not like the gap between the rich and the poor that Wall Street has come to represent, but they need Wall Street all the same. It loans savers’ money to businesses in need, allows for credit card transactions, and provides small investors with opportunities to buy low-cost stocks. Society can’t survive without banks and bankers ( Bitcoin is still far from replacing them), which play critical roles in channeling savings into investments. Because of Wall Street, we have a system that we can trust to handle our money properly.\n",
            "[Doc 308]: Hotdogs and sandwiches are complete meals delivered by means of bread, unified in their portability and relatively lack of mess (well, as long as you stay away from chilidogs). More than allowing diners to pack several food groups into a compact unit, sandwiches are vehicles of self-expression . Are you a minimalist or maximalist? A non-conformist or a traditionalist? The hotdog is but one of the many sandwich-y ways we express personality through cuisine.\n",
            "[Doc 3308]: There is no question that taxation is needed for common programs that benefit the great majority of people. Taxes are needed for roads, schools, law enforcement, the military and other programs of this nature which benefit all. The above being said, there is a point at which taxation can become unjust, confiscatory and oppressive. Our Constitution was written to guide us in such matters. Our Constitution guarantees our \"inalienable rights\" which are not granted by men, but by God, (or if you choose personally not to use \"God\", then a power that is higher than mankind). These include the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We are also guaranteed an opportunity to strive for what we may gain by our own labors, whether it be material aquisition, property (land, homes) or a good education. What we are NOT guaranteed is an equal OUTCOME. Thus, when we hear ideas promoted such as \"spreading the wealth\" we need to be careful about the intention behind such a statement. Does the person (or persons) uttering such a phrase mean that we should confiscate the labors (and resulting property) of another to give it to someone else? What would be the justification for such an action? We are at a crossroads in this country in which more and more people are demanding things they feel \"entitled\" to. People have expressed that the government should pay for their college education, their birth control, their homes, and many, many other things - the list is endless. But when we say the \"government\" should pay for these things, what we are really saying is that those who produce - that is, everyone from those who do physical labor to those who run companies - should be taxed to pay for more and more things. Taken to its ultimate conclusion, there will come a point (and, indeed, this point has been reached for many) in which taxation becomes unjustly confiscatory, resulting in what we have already seen - companies hiring less workers and moving overseas; people being discouraged from working or starting businesses because they receive less and less of the rewards of their labor. We have also seen tremendous waste of our tax dollars and a lack of accounting for where our tax dollars go and what they are used for. When we look to government instead of ourselves to supply what we want or need, and government takes from one group of people to give to another, we see a leveling of the masses that begins to take place - not a leveling that takes place in a good way, but one that brings people down, not up. One that equalizes people in poverty and misery, and places them more and more at the mercy of a government that, as history has shown over and over, becomes more tyrannical over time.\n",
            "[Doc 481]: Since more and more businesses have been moving online – even before especially after the coronavirus pandemic hit – it’s only logical that currency should do the same. Some people may be hesitant to adopt a technology that they don’t fully understand, but time is marching on regardless. When cloud technology first came around, many were put off by the idea, yet now it’s a given to use email, social media and online applications to store our memories and information. Similarly, people were initially skeptical of hospitality services like Airbnb, but it had 150 million users worldwide in 2023. Bearing in mind that the amount of available Bitcoin is limited, it may be beneficial to jump on the bandwagon instead of being left in the dust.\n",

Often the family will not be in the room only the father of the child and he necessary doctors. If you look at how humans mate, it is confined to the bedroom. If you look to how we go to the toilet in times where we have choice, we go behind closed doors. Now, look at animals, animals do not hide, they show no shame. They mate in the open, they release their waste in the open and they give birth in the open. Given that this is how they treat their own privacy, why should we think that they value it?

            "[Doc 401]: One of the tell-tale signs of a struggling nation is lack of investment. America’s infrastructure is crumbling. According to the infrastructure report card issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the majority of America’s infrastructure categories have received an overall grade of “D” for the last 20 years. Poor infrastructure has real consequences – lack of maintenance leads to increased accidents (and deaths, as with the Baltimore bridge collapse ) and inefficiency that cost billions of dollars. Health care is another weak point for America. True, America is not the only country that was caught unprepared for the pandemic. However, perhaps its current health care system, with high costs and low medical capacity, contributed to the country’s vulnerability. America has long needed to invest in improving its health care system so that it can better promote health and equality, especially compared to other countries.\n",

His export agreement with China and NAFTA enabled American companies to profit from cheap labor abroad. Around 700,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared.

Additionally, the cheap sale of farm products to Mexico put millions of Mexicans out of work and boosted their coming to America illegally.\n",

It is believed that America actually used the atomic bomb against the Japanese to show the Soviets their strength . This ended up backfiring on America, leading to an arms race in which the Soviets were able to build a bomb of their own by 1949. The world once again came close to nuclear brinkmanship in 1962, during the faceoff between America and the Soviet Union off the shores of Cuba. Though tensions have since cooled with the fall of the Soviet Union, relations are still challenging today between these two powers.\n",

While the first decade of the 21st century saw manufacturing jobs falling, manufacturing output actually grew by $800 billion over the same period . Simply put, if new technology allows one person to do the job previously done by five, it will benefit the consumer and the firm, but cost jobs in that sector.

Yes, this was significant for those workers and their families, but at just 0.1 percent of the US labor force, this figure is far from economically crippling.\n",

            "[Doc 948]: Unions may be well-intended, but their actions can hurt the general population. Most strikes, for example, negatively affect everybody – not just the people unions are trying to negotiate with. Teachers’ strikes, even over coronavirus safety concerns during the pandemic, still hurt children who were trying to learn and parents who needed to find last-minute arrangements for their kids; similarly, a health workers’ strike could potentially endanger the lives of the sick. It seems that this hurting of the general public is a tool that unions will use to get what they want. Moreover, union violence has been used in the past, such as in the Occupy Oakland strike of 2011, which culminated in violent riots that were later condoned by the US Supreme Court.

            "[Doc 1809]: Whilst the freedom of association exists under the state and it is true that people should be allowed to communicate with one another and form groups to forward their personal and political interests, it is not true that the freedom of association automatically grants access to the decision making process. Unions in this instance are problematic because whilst other groups do not have access to special privileges, unions are able to exert a significant and disproportionate amount of influence over the political process through the use of collective bargaining mechanisms. This argument applies to private unions as well, although to a lesser extent, and the banning of collective bargaining for private unions would be principally sound. In the case of unions in the private sector they can cause large amounts of disruption which has a large knock on impact on the economy giving leverage over politicians for whom the economy and jobs are always important issues. For example unions in transport in the private sector are just as disruptive as in the public sector. Even more minor businesses can be significant due to being in supply or logistics chains that are vital for important parts of the economy.1 The access to the decision making process that unions are granted goes above and beyond the rights that we award to all other groups and as such this right, if it can be called one at all, can easily be taken away as it is the removal of an inequality within our system. Further, even if collective bargaining were to be considered a “right,” the government can curtail the rights of individuals and groups of people should it feel the harm to all of society is great enough. We see this with the limits that we put on free speech such that we may prevent the incitement of racial hatred.2\n",

This is particularly relevant following George Floyd’s death, when many people blamed police unions for protecting certain officers who have abused their authority. In addition, although unions are meant to control and prevent worker exploitation, sometimes the reverse ends up happening, where leaders exploit their own members. Unite Here , the former hotel and restaurant workers’ union, reportedly pressured union members to publicly divulge personal information about themselves (bordering on psychological abuse), because they believed it would attract newcomers to the union. Additionally, Philadelphia unions were filmed using intimidation, threats and violence on numerous occasions to get their way.

This was the reality for many in the US before the National Labor Union was introduced in 1886. There was no minimum wage or standard of safety regulations until unions established a precedent with the Fair Labor Standards Act , which put limits on child labor and demanded fair pay for overtime work. The benefits many in the workforce have come to rely on are also a result of past unions’ work; dramatic improvements that we now take for granted, such as sick leave, paid vacation, including for Labor Day , which celebrates workers, and pension, were only introduced into the workforce after unions fought against the terrible conditions that plagued the working class. Still today, unionization is way for employees to fight for better working conditions, though attempts to unionize may be challenging (just ask some Starbucks workers) or may not always be successful (just as some Amazon workers).\n",

This is something the government did not invent and not something it can simply wash out of society. Shelving the bill would not suddenly create tolerance from Ugandan society towards the gay community but instead would isolate and impose a threat to the LGBT community. Others would have tried to create laws anti-gay laws. This ‘kill the Gays bill’ was originally intended to include the death penalty for some homosexual acts such as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\".

(This was particularly important when educators faced hard choices and unintended consequences during the pandemic.) This extends to all members of a unionized workplace, regardless of whether said members are in the union or not. For example, in 2018, low-cost airline Ryanair pilot unions succeeded in their struggle to improve pay and conditions across Europe.

In films where 'the hero wins' and 'the villain loses', the morality is entirely bipolar, teaching children that some people are good and some people are evil and we shouldn't question this. This kind of thinking isn't what we need in a situation where it has already caused wars. In original versions of fairy tales, the morality is often quite complex, with main characters performing evil actions, the most unsympathetic people turning out not to be evil and nothing being as it seems.

Today’s banks promise security through technology – banks protect clients by offering highly encrypted digital transactions, early fraud warnings, and as of late, biometrics . Victims of digital fraud are protected by their banks and by the FTC, which imposes limitations on customer liabilities.

Additionally, they assist students with financing post-secondary degrees and help families move into their own homes.

These businesses diversify – and therefore strengthen – the economy.

Moreover, centralized banks place important controls on interest rates and the influx of money into the economy, thereby controlling inflation and pricing, and helping national and international economies to mitigate financial downturns.

His support for deregulatory action helped pave the way for out-of-control speculation on Wall Street and, eventually, the 2008 financial crisis. One example of Greenspan’s deregulatory zeal is his role in weakening and eventually scrapping the Glass-Steagall act , which allowed “too big to fail” banks to get even bigger. And for years, he opposed efforts to regulate derivatives , which spun out of control in the leadup to the crisis. Greenspan himself said after the crisis that he made a mistake in presuming that the self-interest of organizations, specifically banks and others, were capable of protecting their own shareholders.

            "[Doc 375]: While much of the praise of Jeter understandably focuses on his clutch hitting , leadership, and intangibles, it is important not to overlook his unparalleled hitting statistics.

He also leads all shortstops in runs ( Alex Rodriguez has him narrowly beat in this category but played less than half his games at the position), while his .310 career batting average is 35 points higher than Cal Ripken Jr. and Ernie Banks, two top contenders for the honor. Jeter is not known as a power hitter, and he certainly never threatened either of Barry Bonds’ home run records. But his 260 career home runs are more than all but two Hall of Fame shortstops (Banks and Ripken), and they blow away Honus Wagner’s 101.

They depict unqualified “brokers” using high-pressure sales tactics to convince unsuspecting civilians to invest with them, usually by giving them false information about various stocks. The brokers become millionaires, and the people who invest with them often lose their money. Unfortunately, these movies aren’t works of imaginative fiction; The W olf of Wall Street is based on a true story , and there are many examples of real-life corruption among Wall Street’s banks. For instance, JPMorgan Chase paid $410 million in penalties for manipulating electricity markets in California in 2013. Additionally, that same year, $5.6 billion was paid by six major banks in response to allegations that their investment banking traders tried to manipulate foreign exchange rates. More recently, in December 2019, Goldman Sachs began talks with the US government about a possible $2 billion settlement and a potential admission of guilt over their alleged role in a Malaysian corruption scandal.\n",
            "[Doc 4065]: Free-market principles have been brought into question as a result of the banking crisis, and the subsequent global recession. Many agree that complete lack of regulation is no longer desirable. Equally, however, excessive government regulation in any part of the economy could yet backfire. How can the best of both worlds - free marketeering and government regulation - be ensured? Through smart policies like ours. A benefit of our policy is that it is an illustration of how to get the mix between regulation and hands-off liberalism, correct. Our policy is based on the ideological conviction that the state has a political and ethical mandate to ensure that social disasters, like economic recessions, are either avoided, or that steps are taken to minimise the impact of recessions that do arise. Given that our mechanism, as already proven, is an effective tool for minimising the possibility, and certainly the impact, of a banking crisis - it is therefore a policy that exhibits responsible government. Yet, at the same time, the policy falls short of being unduly, and unacceptably, prescriptive. Banks are still left with a fundamental capacity to make autonomous economic decisions within the reasonable constraint imposed by our policy. Thus our policy is consistent with economic freedom, and the recognition of the importance of allowing economic agents, banks included, the space to play freely with each other - ensuring the textbook benefits of economic liberalism, but with a safety valve necessitated, ultimately, by our inherent human capacity to be self-destructively imprudent.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 933]: Another low-risk investment that is better than real estate is an IRA (individual retirement account). There are many investment options within the account – such as trading options or mutual funds – but you can also just put plain old money away for the future. Where real estate investments incur taxes, the assets you funnel into specific IRAs (like Roth IRAs ) can grow tax-free, and your money can be withdrawn without income tax penalties. There are several kinds of IRAs available that differ based on your income level, but there is usually a suitable option for everyone. Retiring with money in an IRA is the tax-free blessing that real estate isn’t.\n",
            "[Doc 302]: Inflation may seem like a dirty word, but for real estate investors, it can actually be an advantage. While returns on assets like bonds can be undervalued due to inflation, real estate generally keeps pace with it (emphasis on “generally”). This is because home and rent values usually increase during times of inflation, matching the rate at which the value of the dollar drops. In fact, inflation can even increase the value of a real estate investment and lower the difficulty of paying back mortgage debt over time (assuming the interest rate on your mortgage is fixed).\n",
            "[Doc 1137]: Like real estate, stocks have been shown to be good hedges against inflation. This means that their value is protected over time when the dollar becomes worth less than it was when you bought the stock. But real estate is expensive, while stocks like ETFs ( exchange-traded funds ) generally have very low fees . They are based on indexes , meaning a group of companies or stocks which pertains to a specific sector of the market on which the management is an expert. This can help you diversify your portfolio without investing in a bunch of individual stocks or spending a lot of money. Also, the most money you can lose with stocks is the original amount you invested, where you can lose more than the principal value of your real estate investment due to maintenance and insurance costs. Investing in stocks minimizes risk and won’t make you house-poor like real estate can.\n",
            "[Doc 739]: While the appreciation of the value of certain assets depend on external markets, real estate is what you do with it. For example, you may not know if a company you’ve invested in is about to hire a new CEO whose decisions will ultimately drive the price of their stocks down. On the other hand, you can choose where to buy your property, how much you want to renovate it, who you want to rent to, and how much to invest in the upkeep; all of which can determine how good your investment is. In other words, the ability to profit from your real estate investment lies in your hands.\n",
            "[Doc 1162]: Not only is property a tangible thing to look at but renting it out will also put money in your hands every month. Renting helps you generate an ongoing income source and can be part of an overall strategy to begin building wealth . Unlike other investments that need to be cashed in, owning real estate gives you money that you can use in real time (even to pay the mortgage on the property you rent out). After this money accumulates, it can be used to buy other properties and grow your investment portfolio. Also, putting aside Covid-19 , people still need homes to rent during times of economic unrest (as they may have trouble buying themselves), so your investment may even pay off in times of overall financial strain.\n",
            "[Doc 980]: Instead of pouring your money into a property that ties you down, start the business you’ve always wanted to. Aside from having the freedom to choose your own hours and allocate your energy however you want, you can do something that’s both satisfying and lucrative. While starting your own business may be risky, it gives you the potential to grow revenue that far surpasses a monthly rent check. Additionally, you’ll have tax benefits as a business owner that you won’t be able to enjoy if you invest in real estate. Real estate income may feel safer, but it won’t give you the same earning potential or emotional fulfillment that starting a business can.\n",
            "[Doc 3816]: One of the main forces that helped our society to become the way it is was entrepreneurial spirit of businessmen. The desire of theirs to make a fortune makes the lives of everyone easier and better. What we want to have in our society is a better environment for entrepreneurs where they can sustain their businesses – the businesses that are value-adding to the society as a whole. Estate tax is something that effectively destroys family businesses. We definitely do not claim that it is happening in all an every instance, but there are cases where such taxation is disruptive to businesses. Consider a family business of substantial value. It has been successful for many years, expanding at a rapid pace. The owner was happy to finance the expansion with retained earnings – but now he finds himself in trouble, because in case of his death, his son would not be able to pay without selling a share of his business. These are the situations we are extremely discontent with, because people who create the most value in our society are unjustly punished. Scientific studies show detrimental effects of inheritance taxes to entrepreneurial activity. Holtz-Eakin finds evidence that entrepreneurs would decrease business expansion if they would be subject to estate tax after death. This is very plausible indeed – when business owners are subject to tax, they will not expand their business so much, instead, they will put away some money so that they could be used in case of owner’s death to pay the estate tax.\n",
            "[Doc 1591]: Artists generating ideas and using their effort to produce an intangible good, be it a new song, painting, film, etc. have a property right over those ideas and the products that arise from them. It is the effort to produce a real good, albeit an intangible one, that marks the difference between an idea in someone’s head that he or she does not act upon, and an artistic creation brought forth into the world. Developing new inventions, songs, and brands are all very intensive endeavours, taking time, energy, and often a considerable amount of financial investment, if only from earnings forgone in the time necessary to produce the work. Artists deserve as a matter of principle to benefit from the products of the effort of creation. Each is a real thing, even if one can be touched while the other is intangible in a physical sense. Copyright is the only real scheme that can provide the necessary protection for artists to allow them to enjoy the fruits of their very real labours. John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law.\n",
            "[Doc 1967]: When it is politicians who control both the investment and the amount funds being returned from that investment then they have an incentive to encourage more investment. They will want more exploration to find more resources, they will promote technological advances to be able to extract more from the same fields, and they will be willing to grant more production licences. If on the other hand the money goes into a trust fund then the government and parliament has little incentive to encourage the market and every incentive to hold it up. The oil only provides a risk; unpopularity due to environmental impacts without any benefit in return. The result will be that the costs of drilling will be seen in the environmental damage it causes while communities do not get any of the benefit as the money is being squirreled away ‘for the future’. This is hindering the market and so reducing the economic benefits to the country.\n",
            "[Doc 1561]: The right to be forgotten is premised on the idea that internet requires additional rights beyond those in the real world. Offline there is no right to demand that people do not to talk about or show photos of your embarrassing moments. Provided that there is no privacy breach, once something is out in public, you cannot take it back. There is no rule enabling you to be forgotten in real life, even if things you have done harm you. Why then do rules have to be different for the internet? In 21st century the internet has become an integral part of our lives and of human communication that it is in fact just another reality for us. We do the same things there as we do in real life – socialise, engage in our hobbies etc. The only difference is that the internet provides us with greater opportunities, such as reaching more people, but that does not change the principle that human interaction online is pretty much the same as offline. If there is no right to be forgotten in real life, there should not be one in the digital one.\n",
            "[Doc 2296]: Parents are the ones who are responsible for their children and they know what is best for their own. Parents are the people who best know their children; they live with them, feed them, understand them, and know how and when is best to broach the topic of sex with their children. Parents are in a very real way the shapers of children’s psyche and development, so their input on a central moral and physical issue such as this must be respected. It is a myth that somehow parents lacks the capacity to deal with an issue like sex. Rather, they are the best suited to it. The fact is that children generally listen to their parents, or at least consider seriously what they are told by them. Furthermore, parents are more capable than teachers, in light of their intimate relationship with their children, to discuss the emotional aspects of sex and relationships, topics that would become jokes in the classroom and the subject of ribald humour.

            "[Doc 2280]: Even if a voucher scheme is used, parents still need to have considerable input in order that their children are able to access the best educational opportunities. Thus, those children who are most vulnerable, i.e. those with inadequate home support structures, will find that they are unable to access the best schools as their parents may lack the desire or knowledge to find out which schools are the best in their area. Further, this problem will be exacerbated by the subsequent dearth of funding at the worst schools.\n",
            "[Doc 1107]: Choosing the best NBA draft year shouldn`t be based on which draft had the best players but on which draft is better as a whole. The 1996 draft was the best draft as a whole since it introduced the largest number of quality players. Five of the first six picks were all-star players. Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to have ever played the game, was chosen as the 13th spot. Steve Nash, another NBA legend, was chosen as the 15th spot. The 1996 draft produced some of the best players , therefore it was the best draft ever.\n",
            "[Doc 3518]: Education of this higher level should be seen as investment, not just of time but also of money. A person who gets a University education can expect to earn more in their life time than someone with just A levels. If we stopped making excuses and put the effort in, we could all afford to go to university, even if we did have to take out personal loans and credit cards. We just have to acknowledge that the three years of living on the breadline is worth it for the future profits that the degree shall reap. Such an investment is not one that the government should have to make on our behalf. It is for our benefit, therefore we should stump the costs. The amount of students leaving university and struggling to get a graduate level job is increasing, therefore why should the government fund free university education when the amount of jobs for graduates are running low?\n",
            "[Doc 1355]: Multiple groups contend that the interactive nature of computer games considerably blurs the line that separates fantasy from reality1. As a result, game players are likely to become psychologically disturbed by the violence contained within these products. It is conceivable that many young gamers will view the new age of video games as fair depictions or representations of reality, real-world themes, real-world personalities, real-world violence. Because violent video games frequently develop and an exaggerated level of violence and destructiveness, they may arouse a belief that in a \"scary world\". If this is true, a greater level of fear and paranoia can be expected from such gamers in the real world than is justified. This may have the potential to lead to many adverse social effects from these gamers, such as social disengagement.

These actors and actresses did not sign up to have thier real lives taped and watched every second. Watching a friend or yourself deal with a disfuntional marriage or depression is heartbreaking, now just imagine that plastered all over the tabloids for some poor shmucks paycheck. How would that make you feel? It is hard enough dealing with real life drama and these celebrities do not need to deal with it in front of a camera. As for being a \"Public Figure\", how about making \"Public Figures\" someone that has the power to change real issues in the world. And even \"Public Figures\" deserve the right to privacy.\n",
            "[Doc 180]: Conventional schools provide structure, diversity and settings that mimic a real-world environment. A set schedule of seven to nine periods a day provides opportunity for students to get exposure to new subjects but also have enough time to digest the material before moving on to the next topic. Students are also exposed to a large, diverse group of peers throughout the school day, and expected to learn how to socialize with them, which is practice for the real world and work force. As populations grow more diverse and multicultural, conventional schooling and its exposure to a wide variety of subjects and people will better prepare students for how to interact in the real world.\n",
            "[Doc 1466]: Unlike most other forms of charity, sponsorship creates a direct link between the person giving money and the person receiving it. People are able to see the ways in which their money is helping others, and this makes them feel good about it – as World Vision International says - “You get to see and feel the difference your support makes\" . Although this is probably not the best reason for people to give their money to those in need, practically speaking (in the real world) it is one of the most effective (it works very well) in encouraging people to give.\n",
            "[Doc 1615]: Whatever the end product, be it music, film, sculpture, or painting, artistic works are the creations of individuals and a property right inheres within them belonging to their creators. An idea is just an idea so long as it remains locked in someone’s mind or is left as an unfinished sketch, etc. But when the art is allowed to bloom in full, it is due to the artist and the artist only. The obsession, the time, the raw talent needed to truly create art is an incredible business, requiring huge investment in energy, time, and effort. It is a matter of the most basic, and one would have hoped self-evident, principle that the person who sacrificed so much to bring forth a piece of art should retain all the rights to it and in particular have the right to profit from it. The ethereal work of the artist is every bit as real as the hard work of a machine. Mandating that all forms of art be released under a creative commons license is an absolute slap in the face to artists and to the artistic endeavour as a whole. It implies that somehow the work is not entirely the artist’s own, that because it is art it is somehow so different as to be worthy of being shunted into the public sphere without the real consent of the artist. This is a gross robbing of the artist’s right over his or her own work. If property rights are to have any meaning, they must have a universal protection. This policy represents a fundamental erosion of the right to property, and attacks one sector of productive life that is essential for the giving of colour to the human experience. This policy serves only to devalue that contribution. John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law.\n",

Not to mention, in times of global pandemics, working from home can turn into a protective measure . Time economy for telecommuters is also a distinct advantage – hours not spent commuting can be applied to work, household upkeep, or even exercise or sleep. Work-from-home opportunities increase overall household incomes by providing opportunities for individuals who are not able to arrive to traditional jobs , like parents with young children, retirees, and the disabled . Companies who employ telecommuters save money on real estate, utilities, training. Plus, work-from-home arrangements have even been proven to encourage employee retention .

The main difference between investing in real estate and investing in stocks is that real estate involves buying properties and renting them out or investing in REITs (real estate investment trusts), whereas investing in stocks involves buying a small slice of a company and waiting for those shares to increase in value.

There are lots of metrics you can look at when figuring out if investing in real estate or stocks will make you more money. * Real estate investments can be more work than stocks.

If you are among the Americans that want exposure to real estate or gold, there are different ways to do it wisely, experts say.

Here are some tips for analyzing real estate rental properties and steps to get started. Just as it sounds, an investment property is “any real estate property purchased with the intention of earning a return on the investment either through rental income, the future resale of the property, or both.” Rental properties are the most common investment option, as they can reliably generate steady income and allow you to retain ownership of the property, accruing more wealth as the property appreciates in value. Also known as the cap rate, this is the rate of return that is expected to be generated on a real estate investment property. Return on investment (ROI) is the expected profits from a rental property, as a percentage. In real estate, this means that a property is only a good investment if it will generate at least 2% of the property’s purchase price each month in cash flow.\n",

            "[Doc 947]: In the iOS or Android debate, the former far outshines the latter when it comes to updating devices with the newest operating system, and it has proven to have better support for older phone models than does Android. For example, iOS 11 – which was released in the end of 2017 – was installed on 66% of compatible devices within six weeks, and had full support for the iPhone 5S (a four-year-old phone). In contrast, Android’s Oreo (released around the same time) had only made it onto 0.2% of Android devices more than eight weeks after its release, and Android 7 was only running on 18% of phones after an entire year. Where Android severely lags in giving its users the best possible version of their phones, iOS is full speed ahead. As of Dec 2019, an estimated 50% of all iOS phones were running the latest version, a figure that will be lower for Android. Not counting Android 10, only about 10% of Android devices ran the previous version, Android 9.0 Pie.\n",
            "[Doc 1152]: When contemplating iOS or Android, both have what to offer in terms of quality, but Android provides the quality at lower cost . For developers , publishing an unlimited number of apps through the Android marketplace is affordable at $25 – where iOS costs $99 for the same – and there is a higher percentage of free apps in Google Play Store than in the iOS App Store. This, combined with the fact that Android provides low-cost, quality handsets that are hundreds of dollars cheaper than iPhone’s newer models, makes the choice a simple one. The proof is in the numbers: Android holds almost 75% of market share around the world.\n",
            "[Doc 1170]: “Macs don’t get viruses,” was the common trope paraded around when Apple first introduced their distinguished computers – and this statement extended to iPhones. iOS products are far less susceptible to viruses than Android, because of Apple’s level of exclusivity. iPhone apps can only be installed from the Apple Mac Store, providing a level of control over the malware that gets through. This seems to work effectively, as a much higher percentage of mobile malware targets Android than iOS; one study found that 97% of all malware written in 2015 was geared towards Android, and another estimated that just 0.7% of threats were aimed at iOS. So, to answer whether iOS or Android, when choosing the right phone for you, it seems that iOS is the safer choice.\n",
            "[Doc 996]: The Android platform is an open-source system , which means you can have access to any apps you want, regardless of the maker – over a million more than iOS provides. Additionally, any phone carrier can create devices for Android, and users can download any available Android system. In contrast, as mentioned above, iOS is exclusive, mainly because it’s a closed-source system. This locks you in to using everything Apple once you commit to iOS; your devices will only be compatible with other Apple products, you can only troubleshoot technical issues in an Apple Store, and your available apps are limited to whatever Apple decides you should have.\n",
            "[Doc 990]: Android is the future, holding court when it comes to voice interfaces and AI . Google Assistant (GA) far surpasses Siri as a virtual assistant, with more accurate responses to questions and tailor-made service; for example, GA can read text on images and convert it into meaningful calendar updates, notes, etc., while Siri is still trying to piece together the answers to basic questions. Not to mention that Google, basically the infrastructure of the web, has a much bigger fountain of data from which to draw when perfecting their services. There doesn’t seem to be much to consider when asking iOS or Android . Not to mention, Android is coming out with phones that cater to both individual consumers and various industries, which feature removable batteries and walkie-talkies . The company’s focus on varied users’ needs offer more variety and function.\n",
            "[Doc 779]: Children are growing up in a world dominated by smartphones. Instead of keeping this significant societal change outside of school and trying to pretend it doesn’t exist, we are better off educating students in school about the benefits and risks of smartphone use (and overuse). This includes teaching children about digital and cyberbullying and its harmful effects and how to responsibly use various social media platforms that are accessible from their smartphones. Teachers can also encourage children to question information and sources that they are exposed to on their smartphones, and how to become more media-savvy, which is an especially important lesson in today’s age of “ fake news .”\n",
            "[Doc 3141]: Childrens' main role models are either their parents, their teachers, each other, or other adults they see on TV. If you want children to behave better, you need to act better.\n",
            "[Doc 3921]: Every day, children could be in their last hour writing a story, doing persuasive writing or other important work, when the bell might ring. They come back the next day and can't remember what they were going to write. This isn't good, especially in a test, when you could then receive bad marks, which may be part of their reports. If you want a better report, to do better at school, and have a better life, I suggest that school hours should be extended.\n",
            "[Doc 3709]: If school was optional it would make life better.\n",
            "[Doc 1024]: For some children, screens are also used as a place of refuge . Kids, especially socially awkward ones, sometimes lack the social skills required to make or interact with friends. They may shy away from social interactions if they feel out of place. But face-to-face interaction is a critical life skill . When we interact with others, we are continuously processing wordless signals like facial expressions, tone of voice, and even the physical distance between us. Equipping children with smartphones may increase the chance that they will choose the phone over learning to socialize with other kids. This will make it harder for them in the long term to face social situations as they grow up. Sure, the pandemic and its lockdowns altered what parents considered a normal amount of smartphone and screen time for kids. But the consequences of too much screen time – which school is supposed to be an escape from – can include increased obesity, irregular sleep, impaired academic performance, desensitization to violence, etc.\n",
            "[Doc 981]: Time is linear because of the different and cumulative ways we can record and measure it. Our Smartphone stopwatches measure time in milliseconds. This may be an absurd level of precision for daily life, but it is increasingly important as we push the limits of human athletic performance. We can also measure time by counting the number of times the Earth goes around the Sun , just as humans have done for thousands of years. If counted, this shows linear progress from a starting point onward. Or we can measure the vibration of cesium-133 atoms, as is done to set International Atomic Time . That global standard is so accurate that it will take 1.4 million years for it to be off by a full second. These natural phenomena can be recorded in long, cumulative and linear sequences.\n",
            "[Doc 3531]: Just as we have the right choose whether or not to buy organic or eat really fatty foods, or buy a ridiculously expensive car , we also have the right to choose a good education for our children, whether or not this is a choice that everyboy has. It is unreasonable to expect everybody to have to send their children to a state school that they feel is unsuitable, rather than a better resourced, better run private school simply because there are others unfortunate enough not to be able to have this choice.\n",

Once notorious for being the “copycat” nation, it now boasts strong entrepreneurial spirit nearly akin to that of Silicon Valley. Its digital payments market is far more developed and prevalent than that of the US. By 2021, it is projected that nearly 80% of all of China’s smartphone users will be using their phones instead of cash or credit cards at points of sale, compared to only 31% of Americans. Its two largest internet companies – Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings – are leaders in online gaming, social media and ecommerce. From the lightweight, cutting-edge Mavic Pro drone (which controls over 70% of the commercial drone market), to the rise and fall of its bike-sharing industry and all-inclusive app WeChat , the technological innovation emerging from China that once would have been met with skepticism from the West is now met with due admiration.\n",

            "[Doc 102]: While people have the choice of whether to use Google’s services, the fact is that it’s expected, and difficult to survive the corporate or social worlds without it. Corporations thrive on using Google Hangouts to communicate and Google Calendar to share schedules between employees. Gmail has 1.5 billion users , which means the company has access to that many emails. Google Maps – which automatically comes with any Android phone – gives Google your exact location, at all times. None of this addresses the access the company has to your search history , from which they compile a profile of you in order to target you with relevant advertisements. Is Google too powerful? Consider this: Its search engine market share is 90% . The US government seems to think that Google is an illegal monopoly and is consequently suing the tech giant to break it up and halt alleged antitrust abuses. While Facebook gets a lot of flak for data manipulation , you have to choose to be on one of their three platforms to have your data compromised; Google, on the other hand, is practically the whole web , with minimal competitors , so no place is safe – not even your health records ! A 2019 hospital data-sharing deal highlights these privacy issues.\n",
            "[Doc 3679]: It is clear to see that the countries to whom the debts are owed do not need the money, and that it could be better spent on proving a better standard of life for the citizens of the debtor country. Really you'd let people die on a matter of principle.\n",
            "[Doc 526]: Small-change apps make investing accessible to everyone, without breaking the bank. Slightly over half ( 58% ) of American households own stocks, with 89% of the market belonging to households that earn more than $100K or more. Investment apps allow anyone with a smartphone and some spare change to have a chance to grow their money. Unlike mutual funds, most of which often require a minimum investment of $500-$5,000, these apps let you allocate mere pennies towards your investments if that’s all you have to spare. For example, the celebrity -sponsored app Acorns allows people to mindlessly invest their spare change, by rounding credit card purchases up and investing the extra change across a number of stocks. Such apps provide a solution for lower-income Americans to save.\n",
            "[Doc 1807]: A Unified Ireland would be better off economically.\n",
            "[Doc 1188]: Besides its search engine, the company’s other platforms have also positively reshaped the ways in which we function – for no direct fee. YouTube has transformed the music, television and advertising industries, putting a new, democratic spin on the idea of celebrity. It recently introduced a console-free cloud-gaming platform . Google’s APIs for Android has allowed people to develop their own apps and utilize them to grow revenue. Gmail, Chrome, Google Maps and Google Photos have way over 2 billion users combined, with Google Drive closing in on 1 billion users itself. Just building and maintaining data centers to support such platforms costs upwards of $10 billion , but the company enables free use of every product. It has created scores and scores of free, useful tools that have altered the way humans exist day to day.\n",
            "[Doc 2247]: Studies show that students in year-round schooling tend to get perform better on many assessment metrics than those who do not . Schools operating a year-round calendar do not have to cram so much course content into a 9 month schedule, but can space out learning better. This allows teaching to proceed at a more logical pace, helping students learn better. Furthermore, by giving students frequent short breaks (instead of two or three long ones), pupils are refreshed and ready to learn when school resumes.\n",
            "[Doc https://www.jetking.com/blog/top-10-differences-between-iphone-and-android-ios-vs-android]: If you value customization, a broader range of hardware options, and budget-friendly choices, Android may be the better option. Conversely, if\n",
            "[Doc https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/iphone-vs-android]: We test a lot of phones, iPhones and Android devices alike, so we have a good sense of where the different phones shine and falter. When it comes to hardware, there isn’t that much difference between the best iPhones and the best Android phones. Because Apple controls both the software and hardware for its phones, it’s able to add features in iOS that work across its devices — not just iPhones, but Macs, Apple Watches and iPads as well. iPhone apps tend to cost more than their Android counterparts, with many of the best iPhone games locked behind the Apple Arcade paywall. While Google features are fairly polished, the same can’t be said of devices like the Motorola Edge 50 Pro. And given the irregular update schedule for Android devices, new AI features won’t appear with the regularity you’ll get with an iPhone. For years, Apple had a big performance edge over Android devices, with iPhones typically posting much better Geekbench scores.\n",
            "[Doc https://www.netguru.com/blog/iphone-vs-android-users-differences]: However, while Android prevails in the number of users and apps, iOS is ahead when it comes to mobile app revenue globally. * Android users are more responsive to push notifications – Android apps tend to perform better than iOS apps when it comes to user engagement from push notifications (based on a 2021 report from Airship). * iPhone users spend more on in-app purchases – The global average in-app spend per user, per app in 2022 for Android users is $0.47 and $1 for iOS users (according to Statista). * Target market and demographic – If the app is intended for users outside of the United States and other high-income economies where iPhone leads the market (e.g. UK, Canada, Japan), developing it first on Android is likely to be the optimal decision. Conversely, if the app is predominantly aimed at markets where the iPhone has a stronger presence than Android devices, going for iOS is the preferable option.\n",
            "[Doc https://www.pcmag.com/comparisons/android-vs-ios-which-mobile-os-is-best]: If you're looking to buy a new phone, you have two primary mobile operating systems to choice from: a handset running Apple iOS or Google Android. Apple's other Continuity features\") are hard to beat, but thanks to the Windows Phone Link app and Android cross-device connectivity, you can connect an Android phone with PCs just as effectively as iPhones connect with Macs. Like Android, the iOS Camera app has many useful tools beyond snapping photos (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo). Android lets you create 360-degree photos, whereas iOS users require a separate app for this feature. As mentioned, Android doesn't limit you to its own parental controls, allowing you to use third-party options like Aura and Bark.Google's Family Link app allows parents to view their kids' activity, approve app downloads, set screen time limits, lock their device, and track their location. Like Android, iOS has a mode that reduces distractions by letting you customize which notifications, calls, and apps are active (Credit: Zooey Liao/PCMag Composite; Gabriel Zamora).\n",
            "[Doc https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/blog/android-vs-ios/]: ### 2) User Interface (UI) and Ease of Use. Android offers more customisation and personalisation options and allows users to change the look and feel of their devices with various launchers, widgets, themes, and apps. Android and iOS have some security and privacy features that can protect the user’s data and device from unauthorised access and malicious attacks. While iOS is generally regarded as more secure and private than Android due to its closed and controlled system paired with a rigorous app review process, it also offers exclusive features like Face ID, which employs facial recognition to lock or unlock the device, and iMessage, which safeguards messages. Apple controls everything in iOS, since they make all their own iPhones and iPads, while other companies like Android run their software on devices made by several companies. Devices that run Android cover more of the market, but iOS offers better reliability with the same kind of hardware and software working across all devices.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 2493]: Because the federal minimum wage is not indexed for inflation, its purchasing power (the number of goods that can be bought with a unit of currency) has dropped considerably since its peak in 1968. The minimum wage in 1968 was $1.60, which is equivalent to $11.16 in Jan. 2016 dollars and which is 53.9% higher than today's $7.25 federal minimum wage. Between July 2015 and the last increase in the minimum wage in 2009, the federal minimum wage lost 8.1% of its purchasing power to inflation. According to Liana Fox, PhD, Senior Analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, \"inflation indexing guarantees low-wage workers a wage that keeps pace with the rising costs of goods and services.\" Raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation would ensure that low-wage workers could adopt a standard of living commensurate with the current economy.\n",
            "[Doc 2390]: Without a minimum wage, the lowest paid members of society are relegated to effective serfdom, and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit, accepting similarly low wages. There is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure, since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families. Their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages. The minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices. Because people’s choices are intrinsically interconnected, and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply, when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else, he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask, leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another, each competing to prove he is worth the least. A minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition. People want to be happy, and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment. Fundamentally, the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited, giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies.\n",
            "[Doc 2497]: According to a 2013 study by Boston College economists, increasing the minimum wage leads to reduced employment which leads to an increase in thefts, drug sales, and violent crime. Their results indicate that \"crime will increase by 1.9 percentage points among 14-30 year-olds as the minimum wage increases.\" Researchers found that between 1977 and 2012 increases in the minimum wage resulted in \"no significant change\" in the rates of violent crime or property crime.\n",
            "[Doc 2389]: Businesses operating in a free market are concerned principally with their bottom lines. In order to increase profits, firms will seek to exploit workers, to lower wages as far as possible. This exploitation will continue indefinitely, unless the state intervenes. The state does so by implementing a minimum wage. The lowest paid workers tend to be less educated, less skilled, and less organized than higher-paid employees. This makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace. Certainly, it is far better for state, which has citizens’ best interest at heart, to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses, which tend not to care about their workers’ welfare or have competing interests. Furthermore, a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation; it affirms that all people have worth, cannot be exploited, and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce, i.e. This is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society, by encouraging them to value themselves. Also, the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities. This form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage, in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery.\n",
            "[Doc 736]: By raising the minimum wage, we force businesses to make up for the loss of capital somehow. Often their only way to offset this deficit is by increasing prices for consumers . If we force them to pay a higher minimum wage than they would have naturally, the prices for consumers of all goods and services go up. This will hurt consumption and business profits, from which the government will reap less taxes.\n",
            "[Doc 332]: In a free market, salaries are as high as the jobs that earn them are valuable. By forcing companies to raise salaries higher than the output of such jobs, they will be forced to discontinue them. No longer able to make a profit, companies would have to send some workers home without any job at all, rather than giving them a steady income. Low-income workers would be at the highest risk of being fired since their work wouldn’t be profitable any longer. A 2010 study estimated that raising the minimum wage to $9.50 would end nearly 1.3 million jobs. This article argues that Seattle has already started losing jobs due to its raised minimum wage.\n",
            "[Doc 2495]: Jamie Richardson, MBA, Vice President of fast food chain White Castle, said that the company would be forced to close almost half its stores and let go thousands of workers if the federal minimum wage were raised to $15. reported that an increase in the minimum wage has led to the closure of several Wal-Mart stores and the cancellation of promised stores yet to open.\n",
            "[Doc 2392]: When wages are extremely low the incentive to enter alternative markets is increased. This is particularly harmful in the case of illegal markets, such as those for drugs or prostitution. The minimum wage is essential for keeping the opportunity cost of entering the black market sufficiently high that people opt always to enter the mainstream, legal market. Furthermore, when the possibility of work in the legitimate market exists, even if work is harder to find due to a minimum wage, the very possibility of getting such a job will serve as a disincentive to pursuing illegal employment.\n",
            "[Doc 2496]: A survey by the Small Business Network found that 82% of small businesses agreed that \"the government should not be setting wage rates.\" According to Per Bylund, PhD, Research Professor at Baylor University, the federal minimum wage \"disrupts the balance of the market and prohibits the creation of new jobs.\" Bylund stated that the free market should determine wages based on the value of work produced so employers can hire the needed number of workers at wage levels that make sense for their businesses. According to Mark J. Perry, PhD, of the American Enterprise Institute, government-mandated minimum wages \"are always arbitrary and almost never based on any sound economic/cost-benefit analysis... n contrast market-determined wages reflect supply and demand conditions that are specific to local market conditions and vary widely by geographic region and by industry.\" Perry said market-determined wages result in more employment opportunities for unskilled workers, increased profits for companies, and lower prices for the consumer.\n",
            "[Doc 854]: The 20 richest Americans own as much wealth as the bottom half of the country combined . The US lags far behind other developed countries in terms of income inequality. A plan to raise the minimum wage to $12/h by 2020 would lift 4.5 million Americans out of poverty. Income inequality has been shown to fuel social tension so reducing it is in everyone’s best interest. Besides being the morally compassionate thing to do, it would allow America to become a more equal and fair society.\n",
            "[Doc 2391]: Employees work harder when they are paid more, but employers can often be more concerned with the short-term bottom line and will not treat workers in the lowest echelons of their firms with much consideration, viewing them instead as disposable and replaceable economic units. Furthermore, better pay means more disposable income in the hands of employees, which leads to greater demand by them for goods and services. This demand-induced economic growth is a very important part of economic growth. The more people are able to spend, the more money flows into the economy, leading to more business and higher employment. Without the minimum wage, a downward spiral of spending can ensue, proving deleterious to firms and the economy generally. Additionally, the minimum wage decreases expensive social welfare payments, since workers no longer need as many supplements to their wages from the state in order to make up for the shortfall created by too-low wages.\n",
            "[Doc 2393]: Individuals are autonomous beings, capable of making decisions for themselves. This includes the ability to make a value judgment about the value of one’s time and ability. If an individual wishes to sell his labor for a certain price, then he should not be restricted from doing so by the state. A minimum wage is in effect the government saying it can place an appropriate value on an individual, but an individual cannot value himself, which is an absurdity as the individual, who knows himself better than the state ever could, has a better grasp of the value of his own labor. At the most basic level, people should have their right to choice maximized, not circumscribed by arbitrary government impositions. When the state denies individuals the right to choose to work for low wages, it fails in its duty of protection, taking from individuals the right to work while giving them nothing in return other than the chimerical gift of a decent wage, should they ever be able to find a job.\n",
            "[Doc 1096]: Unions help balance racial wage inequality, giving minorities a fair chance in the American workforce. A study found that, if union representation were to endure at high levels, weekly wage gaps between black and white women would be reduced by up to 30%. In general, unionization raises African American wages by over 16% . Women, too, find a 23% increase in salaries when represented by unions, which significantly narrows the gender wage gap . While there may still be discrimination in the workforce, unions are an important tool through which to level the playing field for all Americans, regardless of race or gender.\n",
            "[Doc 1983]: Incapacitation is one of the 4 basic reasons for punishment. Mandatory minimum sentences keep criminals out of society for a longer period of time than they might otherwise be in jail, thereby reducing their window of opportunity to commit crime. The criminal justice system is obligated to refrain from cruel or unusual punishment, but its main purpose is to protect society from law-breakers through various means of preventing and punishing illegal activity. Mandatory minimum sentences should be proportionate to the severity of the crime, thus satisfying the requirement of humane punishment. Thus mandatory minimum sentencing is a just method of protecting the public.\n",
            "[Doc 1100]: America’s poor often can’t afford to save their money, they need to spend it right away, so it goes towards businesses. Money being spent increases the general cashflow and benefits the economy. According to research done at Per Capita rich people are far more likely to save their money, putting it in the bank, where it serves the economy less. Raising the minimum wage helps businesses by allowing more Americans to buy their products.\n",
            "[Doc 2382]: Labour and business standards are a cornerstone of agreement on universal human rights between various international actors and so it is right that they should be linked to aid. In 1998 the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work were adopted and are considered binding on all members regardless of whether they have ratified the conventions. This then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up. It would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid. It should be remembered that there has been general acceptance of international labour standards not just for human rights reasons but also because having minimum standards is beneficial economically – for example a 40 hour working week is more productive per hour than a 60 hour week.\n",
            "[Doc 2479]: Tenure removes incentives for teachers to put in more than the minimum effort and to focus on improving their teaching.\n",
            "[Doc 1982]: Deterrence works through several mechanisms; likelihood of getting caught, severity of punishment, and perceived public disapproval. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the effectiveness of severity as a deterrent. If potential criminals know a mild sentence is possible, they are more likely to commit crime in the hopes that they may charm a judge into sympathetically lowering their sentence. By establishing a set minimum punishment, a potential criminal with any knowledge of the penal code knows that, if caught, he/she will face a substantial punishment for his/her crime. The pro need not demonstrate that every, or even a strong majority, of would-be criminals will be deterred by mandatory minimum sentences; so long as the mandate has a reasonable deterrent effect, it will reduce crime and therefore improve the overall standard of living.\n",
            "[Doc 3564]: You should raise the legal age of driving to 18 because the most wrecks that occur are from teens.Teens have a certain way of thinking that \"I win you lose,\" kind of attitude.Or the \"My way or no way.\"\n",
            "[Doc 2050]: While it is true that crime is correlated with people coming from poorer socio-economic backgrounds this does not in itself prove that poverty itself is the cause of crime. A lack of education or bad parenting might be equally, if not more convincing explanations for both phenomena. The causation may even be reversed, with those who indulge in violent behaviour and who seek illegal short-cuts to success rather than being prepared to hold down a steady job being more likely to end up poor. For example, recent studies have found that street-level drug dealers make less than the minimum wage. In order to tackle crime, therefore, we don’t need to eradicate poverty, but improve people’s internalization of social norms through law enforcement and education.\n",

            "[Doc 1542]: We generally accept the principle that people who create something deserve to benefit from that act of creation as they should own that work. The owners of the work deserve to have the choice to benefit from their own endeavours through having copyright over that work. Sometimes this will mean the copyright will remain with the person who was paid to do the work but most of the time this will mean government ownership. Public funding does not change this fundamental ownership and the quixotic bargain state funding in exchange for mandatory creative commons licensing is a perversion of that ownership. The Texas Emerging Technology Fund is an example of the use of state funding in the private sector to produce socially useful technologies without thieving the ownership of new technologies from their creators. It would clearly be in taxpayers interest if the state is able to make a profit out of the investments that taxpayers funding creates as this would mean taxes could be lower.

            "[Doc 301]: If homeownership were merely about financial imperatives, there would probably be much fewer homeowners. But buying a home is much more than a financial transaction. Buying a home first and foremost answers the human desire for rootedness and continuity. Homes provide a space for families to grow, convene throughout large spans of time, and create memories. A home can house a family through several generations and is a natural nexus of intergenerational bonding . A house’s market value may rise and fall, but a home is truly priceless.\n",
            "[Doc 3441]: To go to a doctor to gain information that could be gained at home seems like a pointless venture. By testing at home for genetic susceptibility to medical conditions, this will better stretch doctors’ valuable time and resources to patients who are ill or who have already contracted such diseases. Furthermore, many people find a trip to the doctor a daunting experience, which they then try to avoid. Thus, medical conditions or potential to contract such conditions may go undetected. By offering home testing kits, this problem can be avoided as patients do not have to directly confront a doctor, learning about their health in the emotional comforts of their home.\n",
            "[Doc 2128]: Money should be spent where it can make most difference. The cost of many methods of adapting to climate change is high compared to the gain.

            "[Doc 758]: For a workaholic, working from home is roughly equivalent to conducting an AA meeting in a distillery – the tools to feed your addiction are precariously close by. And those who are not addicted to work still admit difficulties in setting boundaries between work time and personal time. Conversely, there are also telecommuters who are unable to snap out of “personal mode” when working from home. Those who dream of working in their pajamas often meet the fretful reality that they were about as productive in their waking hours as they were in their sleep. Working at home may actually make it harder to achieve a healthy work-life balance and, therefore, is simply not suitable to all personality types .\n",
            "[Doc 935]: If you have it, home equity , gains from a home’s appreciation value minus monies owed, can be a powerful financial tool. Home equity loans and lines of credit can help to turn a fixed asset into a liquid one. This can be a godsend if you need quick cash for unexpected home or car repairs, or if you suddenly have a medical crisis. Home equity can also help homeowners to finance anticipated expenses like college tuition and vacations at significantly lower interest rates than those offered on student or personal loans. (Plus, the payments are tax deductible – woohoo!). And, homeownership can provide monthly dividends for those who decide to turn their homes into rentals . Even if you downsize to a smaller rental of your own, you’ll pocket the difference each month, which can help turn into savings or even an extra vacation.\n",
            "[Doc 322]: Not all home environments are conducive to at-home learning. Level of education, time, and energy vary among parents, and parents at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum tend to have the least amount of each resource. Wealthier kids are more likely to benefit from homework simply because they have the necessary resources to complete it: adult assistance, home computers and internet access. However, students whose home situations may preclude them from completing homework (for example, older siblings who care for younger siblings or children who need to hold an after-school job) inevitably fall further behind . As such, homework can exacerbate achievement gaps between rich and poor students, rendering homework not only counterproductive, but a barrier to equality.\n",

            "[Doc 1732]: Intellectual property rights are extremely important in the efficient and equitable allocation of ideas to firms and individuals1. The ability to sell intellectual property rights allows the price mechanism to assign ownership to the firms most likely to make a profit, and that are thus most likely to produce the product most efficiently, which will benefit all consumers. Furthermore, the ability to confer intellectual property rights on others is important, as often intellectual property, like licensing and patents, can support inventors' and artists' families after they are incapacitated or die. This is no different from the fact that ownership of physical property can be conferred for the betterment of dependents and family. It is only just that intellectual property be recognized and protected by law, so that it may be efficiently and fairly sold and transferred between parties.\n",
            "[Doc 1730]: An individual's idea, so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden, belongs to him. When he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public, it becomes part of the public domain, and belongs to anyone who can use it. If individuals or firms want to keep something a secret, like a production method, then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product. One should not, however, expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has, since no such ownership right exists1. No one can own an idea. Thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason, since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products. Physical property is a tangible asset, and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards. Ideas do not share this right to protection, because an idea, once spoken, enters the public domain and belongs to everyone. Intellectual Property: In Principle.\n",

This is because the right to the integrity of one’s body, including what is done with its component parts after death, must be held in the highest respect {UNDHR – Article 3 re security of person}. One’s body is one’s most foundational possession. Creating a system that effectively threatens death to anyone who refuses to donate part of their body is only marginally different from making it outright mandatory. The state’s goal is in effect the same: to compel citizens to give up their organs for a purpose the government has deemed socially worthwhile. This is a gross violation of body rights.\n",
            "[Doc 1613]: An individual’s idea only truly belongs solely to them so long as it rests in their mind alone. When they disseminate their ideas to the world they put them in the public domain, and should become the purview of everyone to use. Artists and creators more generally, should not expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea they happen to have, since no such ownership right exists in reality. Thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason, since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products. Physical property is a tangible asset, and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards. Ideas do not share the same order of protection even now because they exist in a different order to physical reality. However, some intellectual property is useful in encouraging investment and invention, allowing people to engage their profit motives to the betterment of society as a whole. To an extent one can also sympathize with the notion that creators deserve to accrue some additional profit for the labour of the creative process, but this can be catered for through Creative Commons non-commercial licenses which reserve commercial rights. This is because art is a social good of a unique order, with its purpose not purely functional, but creative. It only has value in being experienced, and thus releasing these works through creative commons licenses allows the process of artistic experience and sharing proceeds unhindered by outmoded notions of copyright. The right to reap some financial gain still remains for the artists, as their rights still hold over all commercial use of their work. This seems like a fair compromise of the artist’s right to profit from their work and society right to experience and grow from those works. Intellectual Property: In Principle.\n",

Such data can be beneficial to anyone wanting to break in or spy on your once intimate home life. (And what about the nightmare of hackers taking over control of your home?)

Not to mention, in times of global pandemics, working from home can turn into a protective measure . Time economy for telecommuters is also a distinct advantage – hours not spent commuting can be applied to work, household upkeep, or even exercise or sleep. Work-from-home opportunities increase overall household incomes by providing opportunities for individuals who are not able to arrive to traditional jobs , like parents with young children, retirees, and the disabled . Companies who employ telecommuters save money on real estate, utilities, training. Plus, work-from-home arrangements have even been proven to encourage employee retention . What’s more, a recent survey showed that 34% of US workers were willing to take a pay-cut of up to 5% just for the opportunity to work remotely.\n",

The Xbox comes with a HDMI input, which allows you to connect your home cable to your Xbox. If you don’t have cable, the Xbox offers you many alternatives for watching and streaming your favorite shows. The Xbox can also play CD’s and other files from a local storage. Another neat feature Microsoft offers is a linkup to other windows 10 devices. Game streaming allows for people with these devices to play any Xbox game on their devices if they’re connected to the same Wi-Fi.\n",

According to third party, IHS Markit Xbox Live offers the user a more reliable service. With many features of games revolving around the use of network, Xbox offers a more dependable online experience with heightened reliability and speed.\n",
            "[Doc 20]: The popularity of some remastered titles has led to an overabundance, where every game that once enjoyed success is being repackaged for new consoles. Repeatedly releasing updated games erodes the charm of the original creations. Does every game need an update every few years? Did the 2013 edition of Tomb Raider really needed a reappearance for next generation consoles in 2014\n",
            "[Doc 419]: When comparing horsepower here, the PS has a clear advantage on the Xbox. “It has 50% more GPU compute units, allowing for greater parallel processing power that can either be used for onscreen fidelity, or for in-game effects such as real-time physics.” This allows for games to run better on Sony’s platform. The PS$ gives the gamer a better resolution on screen. It run’s on a sharp 1,920 x 1,080 resolution opposed to the Xbox’s 1,600 x 900. This gives us a clearer image on the screen.\n",

People argue over the rules constantly and very few people know them or use them correctly.

How can it be said to be a good thing to follow a system that doesn't work?\n",
            "[Doc 387]: You’ve got to hand it to George Lucas , who was inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s Hidden Fortress , for creating a fable-like battle between darkness and light. The story is a very effective embodiment of good vs. evil. Darth Vader is the ultimate unstoppable force, and Luke Skywalker, with his naïve looks and belief in the goodness of mankind, triumphs against his father’s attempts to lure him to the Dark Side. Moreover, despite it being set in the future and in a galaxy “far, far away,” the use of medieval symbols, such as knighthood, swords, princesses and wise magicians, gives the Star Wars franchise the sense of a legend.\n",
            "[Doc 2196]: By banning alcohol the government is searching for a quick way out of the problem of people excessively drinking, making bad decisions when under the influence of alcohol. Alcoholism and also drunk driving is a problem in many countries over the world. It has taken governments for over 30 years to decrease the number of drunk driver accidents, to decrease the number of drinkers in certain regions. This is a hard campaign battle, the government has to battle. According to a recent study, by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, campaigns contribute to approximately 13 % of decrease in drinking through time. This is a number with which many governments are not satisfied as they are pouring a lot of money in the campaigns. Therefore for the government it seems maybe reasonable to prevent just all citizens from drinking. With this the government might be saying that the problem is fixed (because no one is allowed to drink alcohol anymore), but mainly it is just superficially solving it. As people’s mentality has not changed just through a law passing, they have created only more problematic users, they cannot target with campaigns and so do not impact the society. A quick public message that they fixed the superficial problem, while leaving citizens in their misery.\n",
            "[Doc 3045]: Firstly, all education is not the same. I is an huge over generaliztion to simpy say all education good even within a context of university. For we may learn false or fallacious knowledge or simply bad knowledge. For arguing through a Graduate level framework. I take pleasure every few day to watch something benificial before bed. What I recognize of even the most educational shows they are benificial only to a very general understanding of the topic. Channels such as the history channel are hardly historical and even when they are they are careless to speak with enough accuracy to discriminate between very unliklyness and truth claims. There is often a motivation to make certain topics more exciting but often with the cost of oversimplification. Moreover in attempt to reach greater audiences shows are capped at a intellectual capacity of the casual person. But for a deep level of understanding books can be particularly selected to meet the optimal requirements for the learner. For there may be use in learning basic generals of a topic. But the computer really is the better source then both books or tv. especially with the increase of e-books and the ability to select for individual capacities. But books inable to reader to learn at thier own pace and process information at a pace best for them, while a tv show requires less effort. the learner loses information when attemping to contemplate over a concept of interest for they either miss the continuing the information or do not fully benifit at the from absorbtion of information caused by deeper processing. One of the intuitive motivation for tv vs books is the effort required vs pleasure recieved. For just like any new system of understanding such as learning a new language or learning to type.. once the skill is mastered the effort required for value drops thus increasing the motivation to take advantage of the new skill. thus mastery of reading increases the rate you of value you get out of reading vs the effort put in.. That is for the unpractised reader may be more motivated for tv then books. But as you become more skilled the more you reading becomes valuable. So we may understand that the novice reader cannot percieve the value of reading from a frame work of ignorance. this is not to be taken in an evaluative meaning but rather a descriptive explanation.\n",

Just image yourself out there playing sports with your favorite all-stars, racing in your favorite car, or being in the middle of a battlefield.

            "[Doc 516]: During searches, Amazon users get the added bonus of being presented with similar products or products frequently purchased together. This makes Amazon’s comparison-shopping of brand vs. brand or product vs. related product fast and effortless. Another benefit of shopping on Amazon is the immediacy in which purchases are received. With services like Amazon Prime, the customer journey of “search – select – pay – possess” is near-instantaneous. Since Amazon delivers nearly two-thirds of its own orders directly to consumers, it’s no wonder that the company is giving UPS and FedEx a run for their money, competition that will only benefit consumers. It’s much faster than most other e-commerce stores. This benefit was appreciated during the pandemic lockdowns, as with efforts to combat price gouging. Being the market leader means that the standard Amazon adopts becomes the market standard, which, in turn, benefits all consumers. This can also be seen with Amazon’s PillPack acquisition , which highlights how its embrace of disruptive competition is a good thing for consumers.\n",
            "[Doc 484]: While the musical version is a fun, electrifying show, a feast for all senses that captivates its audience with (26) songs and spectacle , the movie is driven, instead, by the story and character development. The themes of family, fate, and aging, not to mention courage vs. fear, (and let’s not forget the hint of incest) have a more meaningful punch in the movie in a way that evokes identification and empathy.\n",
            "[Doc 182]: Gamers are voting with their wallets that they will buy old games updated for new consoles. That’s why there is no end in sight for which pixelated games of yester-year will next appear in full 1080p. The top selling video games released in 2016 features a Hall of Fame-type list including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Ratchet and Clank. And the enthusiasm isn’t all about the memories. A frequent complaint of new video game releases is dwindling story modes Older titles, where more effort was put in to crafting an engaging solo campaign, can still provide gamers this need.\n",
            "[Doc 882]: Remastered games not only rekindle lost passion for gamers who remember the original, it allows for a whole new generation to enjoy them, and on consoles they’re familiar with. Games like Crash Bandicoot had a profound impact on gaming culture some 20 years ago, and now they can reach a whole new audience by bringing their specs up to speed. What’s more, developers are starting to remaster games, like Halo and the Legend of Zelda, with a feature that allows gamers to toggle between old and new graphic displays.\n",
            "[Doc 1551]: When internet anonymity is used for bullying, it can make the situation much worse. Firstly, perpetrators are much less likely to hold back or be cautious as they are less concerned with the possibility of being caught. This means the bullying is likely to be more intense than when it is done in real life.

            "[Doc 1499]: Out of over 250 countries, only a few are currently headed by women. Therefore, the feminist movement is still needed to fight this battle. Woman still hold lower position in business, the legal profession and in the world of politics. It is therefore hard to argue that the glass ceiling has disintegrated. Until women hold higher positions in these fields the feminist cause has still not achieved its goals- in seeking to create a world where, amongst other things women can advance up the ladder in their career without being blocked by a glass ceiling and held back in lower positions.\n",
            "[Doc 3852]: Many people hesitated from buying Macs in the past because Macs couldn't run windows and some applications are available only on the Windows platform. But since the introduction of Intel-based Macs, Mac users can now run Windows side-by-side with OS X on a Mac and take advantage of both the operating systems, together with the powerful hardware features of the Mac. Dual-booting is made excessively simple through Boot Camp, and virtualisation is easier in Mac's Parallels Desktop than with programs available for Linux. As someone who has tried to grapple with WINE, I can speak from experience. This makes the Mac the only platform which can enable you to run Mac OS X, Windows and Linux distributions on the same computer! Gamers can now run all their games on a Mac after installing windows on it. High end Macs have powerful graphic processors that will satisfy even the fussiest of gamers. Alternatively, with a greater uptake of Macs, a wide variety of games are now available on the OS X platform. One of the many reasons that game developers are flocking to consoles is due to the unpredictability of the hardware on PCs. It becomes harder to design a game when you must support an endless variety of video cards and processors. Macs are easier to develop games for due to the fact that the hardware environment is better controlled, much like consoles. It's not that OS X can't run games, it's that Windows has a bigger market share and therefore, it makes more economic sense for the game developers to create games for the PC market. As the Mac gains more market share, that reality will change.\n",
            "[Doc 1501]: By focusing on women and their problems, feminism fails to recognise that there are inequality issues in which men are the victims. For example: boys are falling behind girls in academic achievement; far less money is spent on combating ‘male’ than ‘female’ diseases (the difference between the amount of research into breast cancer and prostate cancer is a striking.) Last year, an oven cleaner ad drew a thousand-plus complaints for the slogan, “So easy, even a man can use it.” These can only be tackled by recognising that feminism has gone too far. The battle for equality is no longer needed but rather, we must remember feminism was never a tool for women to get their own back.\n",
            "[Doc 3038]: Punishing someone for not voting would add insult to injury. By not voting, a person has actually made a huge sacrifice – they have waived their right to have any say in the running of their country and possibly incurred extreme consequences if the person who is voted in decides to persecute them. If a person doesn't vote, knowing the full consequences of their actions, it is akin to surrendering in battle – an action that, rather than 'lazy', is a powerful decision in itself, not something you do without a good reason. On the corollary, when a person votes, they are making use of their right. They are reaping a reward – it is like one free voucher to slightly more political power than they would otherwise have. While I am not saying it is an unvirtuous thing to vote – I admire anyone who votes for a genuinely ethical party against the advice of a strong majority – I do not think rewarding a reward makes a lot of sense.\n",
            "[Doc 994]: When the law meant to protect you, instead, turns you into prey, it’s understandable to want to take self-defense into your own hands. In Chicago, where there are bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, and where gun shops were banned until 2012, gun control laws are not proving effective. Though the city has some of the toughest gun restrictions in place, it suffers from rising gun and gang violence . The city’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is working to increase public safety, but has an uphill battle . Chicago is just one example of many cities where law-abiding citizens are paying the price – with their lives – of ineffective gun control laws.\n",

For as long as video game consoles have existed, there has been some sort of conflict between owners of rival systems across Atari, Nintendo, SEGA and for the last twenty years or so, Xbox, PlayStation and…still Nintendo. Previously, even if Microsoft was downplaying console sales, there was *at least* this narrative that they had scooped up all these studios to finally make attractive games to compete with Sony’s first party offerings. Sony did have a brilliant bit of success with the Helldivers 2 launch, but they cancelled Naughty Dog’s Last of Us multiplayer game which cost their prized studio years of work, and now Concord, which reportedly has been in development for eight years, is about to unavoidably tank when it’s released tomorrow.

Per Sundin, CEO of Universal Music said the decline in music revenues in the past 8 years can be fully attributed to illegal file sharing. Meanwhile, growth in downloads from iTunes, the biggest legitimate digital service, came to a halt.\n",
            "[Doc 1519]: Illegal immigrants cost the state in money, time and resources. It is difficult to give an accurate number on the cost of illegal immigrants for the rest of the population (the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has come up with numbers as high as $1,183 per household in the state of California1), but they are likely to put a strain on resources by not paying taxes whilst demanding social services such as healthcare and education. As a result, they take taxpayer's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state. Moreover, illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions. This is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down. Removing the illegal workforce would increase the number of jobs available to lawful residents and force employers to pay fair wages and provide safe working conditions.\n",
            "[Doc 3072]: And it's illegal not illeagel. Freedom and power to the people!\n",
            "[Doc 3666]: It's a great idea but in practice how would it work? Taking them out of the shops will leave greater problems since many people smoke because they are addicted and not because they enjoy it. Making something illegal is of course easier than it seems. We must weigh in not only the reasons why, but also how are we going to implement a certain set of provision. We have to realise that making something illegal does not automatically solve a problem, instead it might create even more problems as a repercussion to such a decision. Making illicit drugs such as heroine, cocaine, etc. was agreeably a good decision. However, the consequences of making such commendable decisions also involve the allocation of large amounts of state resources (read: tax payer money) to combat illegal drug trafficking. Apparently, making these drugs illegal did not really stop people from using the drugs (fyi: drugs are still a lucrative business, if not why would people risk their lives to smuggle it). That said, the same goes for cigarettes, I don't see any strong reason that making cigarettes (or smoking them) illegal to be of any use in the context of making people quit the bad habit. People who smoke are addicted to it, and as those people who are addicted to illicit drugs, they will always find ways to circumvent the law. Making smoking illegal does not automatically make the business less profitable. As I see it, the demand for cigarettes are still high everywhere, and this kind of policy would only create \"black markets\" for the item. This in turn would put burden on the law enforcement to combat such black markets (read: more personnel, more funds needed), and of course these burdens would be passed on to tax payers who pays for all the cost of faithfully enforcing such a new law. I believe that the restrictions and requirements which are already in place (i.e. restricting smoking areas, limited advertisement methods) are sufficient enough to tackle the problem. Moreover, the current approach is right on track where the government should sponsor and support policies that would decrease the demand for cigarettes (if the demand for cigarettes were to fall substantially, the business would be less lucrative, and soon enough nobody will be in the cigarette business). This is not a policy that would effectively reduce the demand, simply making it illegal is not addressing to the demand problem.Thus, what I see in this is another burden for the state budget, with little or minimal impact on the real issue at hand.\n",
            "[Doc 3091]: We shouldn’t give people below the age of consent access to contraception, to do so implies a tacit approval of illegal behaviour. Instead we should teach people the dangers of getting pregnant and encourage abstinence as the best method for avoiding unwanted children.\n",
            "[Doc 3071]: Swearing should be in no way illegal. I believe that people are entitled to their free speech, and if people are putting a law against that what happened to our rights? I feel that people are allowed to swear as long as they aren't hurting someone and targeting them with the swear word, however even if they do this they shouldn't be charged. Everyone should be entitled their own freedom of speech, and making it illegal to swear takes away from this. Even though swearing is rude, trashy and a sin people should be entitled and be able to say things they want to, but only if it's not harassing and bullying. Almost everyone swears if something goes wrong, they get hurt, or something just happens and a little swear words pops out, and if we put a law against this i think a lot of drama would happen, when you discuss this topic. In conclusion i feel that people should be able to say what they want when they want, and making swearing illegal would take away from this.\n",
            "[Doc 3597]: Women (and men) should be free to decide what they do with their own bodies. The state has no right to tell them they cannot make a living out of having consensual sex. If individuals are allowed to smoke, drink and even commit suicide without facing legal repercussions, then banning prostitution is simply hypocritical. Forced prostitution 'is' illegal ,which means the 'law' does not protect women/men from being forcibly solicited.People dying to be prostitutes cannot do so alone without facing the law, and therefore have to resort to large illegal criminal underground organisations, that exploit them. Prostitution is one of the oldest ways of making money. Making it illegal does/would not put an end to it.\n",
            "[Doc 3990]: Meat is not inherently wrong. It is something we as human's are designed to eat, we are Apex predators , top of the food chain, we are built to hunt and consume other animals. The arguments that meat is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly do not mean that we should not eat meat, it simply means that we should not eat as much. We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was. I do not believe that this was an immoral way of living, it is not about wether we shoudl eat meat it is about how we currently eat meat. We need to have an awarness of environmental harm and look at reducing it, we need to aknowledge animal cruelty and stop it, we need to farm and prodice efficiently but we do not need to stop eating meat.\n",
            "[Doc 2274]: One way we learn is by repetition, another is by doing things, when doing homework we learn in both of these ways. When we are taught a method at school, such as how to do a type of sum, then we need to practice using that method to make sure we know how to so that we can remember it. If we just learn the method and don’t practice it we will soon forget how we do it.\n",
            "[Doc 2837]: After years of brainwashing from government and police adverts, leaflets, and pressure, most authorities embrace speed cameras and take it as fact that they are correct, without scratching the surface to find out the facts for themselves. However, a few councillors have broken rank and spoken out.\n",
            "[Doc 2874]: Knowledge is our only aid in the fight against global warming and animal protection. We need to know exactly what’s going to happen and how animals will respond in these situations. By sending in specialist animal observers to zoos we can begin to unravel the mystery of how to save these animals for the future events to come. We can discover ways to protect them, we can learn which habitats they can survive in, and we can learn which foods they would be willing to supplement their nutrition from. By learning this, we can help wild animals of the future survive the changing environment.\n",
            "[Doc 181]: Ignoring artists’ wrongdoings gives them legitimacy to continue their unethical and illegal actions. On a smaller scale, we might glorify a rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle that teens will emulate as a result, but this debate doesn’t stop at trashing hotel rooms. As long as rapists, racists and murderers are still being lauded for their work, and artists keep getting the recognition they want, then we, as a society, will be paving the path for others to do the same. Case in point: It has taken more than 2 decades for R Kelly to face legal consequences for his sexual misconduct. Would Michael Jackson still be considered the king of pop had we seen Leaving Neverland earlier? If we stop consuming art by abusers, perhaps other artists will think twice before doing something illegal or behaving unethically.\n",
            "[Doc 1801]: It is impossible to overstate the power that the threat of prosecution has to stay the hand of anyone, including a politician, from transgressing the laws of the state. In fact, we need more aggressive prosecution of politicians. Not a single person has been prosecuted for approval illegal torture or wiretapping. These are illegal actions actually happening which the populace, with only the blunt instrument of voting for or against a politician on the sum total of their policies, is unable to effectively influence. There is no greater deterrent that could be used against politicians.\n",
            "[Doc 4033]: If we are mature and can make our own life decisions on our own, we should be considered legal.\n",
            "[Doc 3658]: There are many things we consume but can’t be measured, healthcare, national defence and education, for example. How do we decide how much everyone should pay for them? To answer just one of the points raised, the childless should pay for other people's children to be educated because education does not just benefit the individual - the benefits a literate worker brings to the economy are such that everyone benefits. A direct tax is fair and progressive, because it demonstrates that we all have equal responsibility for the welfare of others. We live in a state where we believe in helping each other, rather than being selfish and helping only ourselves. That is why we have free public transport for the over-60s and the disabled, that's why we have state education, and why we formed the NHS sixty years ago. None of these would be possible without direct taxation.\n",
            "[Doc 1697]: Mobile phones mean we are never out of contact with our friends, parents, guardians, or if necessary our school. They provide a way we can quickly contact someone if we are in trouble or are lost. Mobiles are most clearly helpful if caught in a large scale disaster such as a flood or earthquake as we can tell rescuers where we are. But they are also helpful for every day security. With a mobile phone parents know where we are and can be quickly contacted if we feel unsafe somewhere.\n",
            "[Doc 1249]: We have always been superior to animals. Just as a lion can kill antelope and a frog can kill insects, so too human beings have struggled their way to the top of the food chain. Why then can we not exercise the power we have earned? Animals exercise their power and we should do the same. It is our natural obligation to do so. The reason we have always killed animals is because we need them. We need meat to be healthy and we need to test medicines on animals to protect our own race. We use animals to further our own race. This too is surely a natural obligation.\n",
            "[Doc 3629]: Since 1984 the law has been 21 years old to consume alcohol. Think back to World Wars and battles before, we had boys, and when I say boys I mean children as young as six or seven on the battlefield. Our country is one of tradition and not much for change. The drinking age was set 24 years ago and has not been touched since, we accept that for what it is, and it is mainly young adults and teens in high school who argue with it. The age now to fight for our country is 18, only three years younger than the drinking age. It's not that long to wait in reality. And most people are generally proud to go fight for their country, if they sign up it is because it's something they want to do. Though drafts have been instated before, it has been several years, so those willing to sign up for the military know what they are getting themselves into.\n",

            "[163/185] Summarizing: The Perspective on Elon Musk\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 242]: As a man with an unhappy childhood and unfortunate circumstances growing up, Musk is a role model for those of lesser means and difficult conditions. Having survived both bullying and emotional abuse, he still managed to code and sell his first video game at 12 years old, and his creativity hasn’t stopped since. His failures were many before his success – though the failures don’t seem to end. Most recently, Musk decided to walk away from the $44 billion Twitter deal despite the legal and reputational risks. Previously, Musk was removed from his CEO position at t wo of his own companies , survived malaria, and oversaw three failed launches after the creation of SpaceX (which left the company almost bankrupt). In 2018, he settled with the SEC after being accused of misleading investors and agreed to step down as Tesla chairman, pay a $20 million fine but to remain as CEO. That same year, a Los Angeles court found Musk not guilty of defamation after he made a series of Tweets, calling a British diver who was part of the life-saving efforts of a Thai youth soccer team a pedophile after the diver rejected Musk’s offer of a submarine. No matter how wealthy, brilliant (or, at times, petulant ), Musk’s experiences with hardship and failure make him relatable to the common man.\n",
            "[Doc 373]: Social comparison theory posits that human beings have an innate drive that leads them to compare themselves to other, more successful people. This can lead to negative self-esteem, envy, and unrealistic standards of success. Musk plays his own part in this comparison, creating the perception that he’s the sole embodiment of technological prowess. Yet, it’s easy to forget that, in reality, Musk wouldn’t have been able to get where he is without government funding , subsidies for electric cars, etc. Furthermore, Musk’s elevation by the public to a capitalist idol “has distorted the flow of capital and talent. Healthy markets don’t take cues from the tweets of one man,” writes American author and business professor Scott Galloway . For example, Musk’s outsized influence on raising (or lowering, in the case of Dogecoin ) the value, popularity and production of cryptocurrency has masked the truth that the high level of carbon emissions from increased mining of Bitcoin significantly reduces if not wipes out any carbon savings of Teslas.\n",
            "[Doc 143]: Musk is a visionary , and his dreams alone have had a positive global impact. His most recent partnership with T-Mobile will make cellphone service available almost everywhere in the US, even remote corners. His car company Tesla has steered the automotive industry towards a new era with semi-autonomous vehicles and electric cars, globally reducing vehicle emissions. Because of Musk, analysts now believe that over half the cars sold by 2040 will be electric. In fact, he aims to sell 20 million electric vehicles in 2030 alone. According to consumer demand , the public agrees with Musk’s vision. Additionally, Musk has demonstrated that the space industry can be privatized, and for the better; his company SpaceX has seen the successful launch of rockets and their successful return back to Earth. It has succeeded in delivering supplies to the International Space Station. These show that privatization ventures may significantly reduce costs of space exploration.\n",
            "[Doc 37]: A man of Musk’s means, brilliance and stature has the power to significantly change the world for the better, yet he often devotes his resources towards projects that are arguably rooted in vanity. For example, his SpaceX Falcon Heavy Test Launch project – in which a Tesla sports car was launched into space – cost $90 million to execute, and didn’t contribute to any scientific or humanitarian gains. That money could have been used to further STEM research , launch satellites into orbit or end malaria, to name a few. Instead, it was used to begin a space race with a car of Musk’s own making, a project Musk defended as something “silly and fun.” Additionally, his Hyperloop project – estimated to cost millions – has been criticized as a parallel transportation network intended for catering to the rich . With money and power often comes hubris, and it seems as though Musk isn’t an exception to this rule. He has particularly shown arrogance with regard to the coronavirus and the stock market, as seen in some of his insensitive and even irresponsible comments dismissing the dangers of COVID-19, and his careless (or deliberate?) Tweets causing tumult in the values of publicly traded companies , with real-life consequences for shareholders.\n",
            "[Doc 655]: Bitcoin is catching on, regardless of any personal aversion to it. It is already considered as one of the world’s top currencies and is becoming more and more mainstream; Elon Musk’s Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in 2021 while certain colleges even accept it as payment. In fact, there are reports that JPMorgan , among others on Wall Street, are accepting Bitcoin as an asset class. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve is reportedly creating a bank-to-bank digital currency, proving just how relevant Bitcoin already is to the future of currency.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 488]: Musk may be worthy of his glory but getting to his end-goal has a price, and he is not necessarily the one paying it. In fact, some critics even go so far as saying that during the height of the global pandemic, he played with his employees’ lives by re-opening his Tesla plant even after two Tesla workers tested positive for COVID-19 and before California authorities recommended re-opening for business. Health risks aside, SpaceX staff have often been presented with impossible tasks , like pulling all-nighters after working 12-hour days, in order to meet the deadlines Musk expects from them. His Tesla workers filed charges in 2017 with the National Labor Board against him, citing coercion, hazardous working conditions, intimidation, illegal surveillance and prevention of worker communications as their main reasons for doing so. Most recently, his attitude toward Twitter is seen by some as nothing short of bullying : He has reportedly disparaged Twitter execs, ridiculed the site’s content policies and complained about a lack of professionalism, all resulting in plummeting the company’s stock prices and morale. After declaring he could run it better, he then walked away from the deal, with no regard for its employees.\n",
            "[Doc 885]: Advancements in AI are rapidly developing, perhaps much faster than the public can appreciate or keep up with. Elon Musk, a purveyor of ingenuity and no stranger to forward-thinking, has often, in the past, spoken out against AI and its potential dangers for this reason. For example, he once said that while Google’s AI and robotics efforts are well-intentioned, the company could end up accidentally building a fleet of AI-driven robots “ capable of destroying mankind .” (That being said, he built and unveiled his own AI-powered Tesla robot in 2022). And let’s not forget about how a rogue Microsoft AI-powered chatbot told a NYT reporter that he and his wife didn’t love each other and then confided that it wanted to steal nuclear codes. Or the time when Facebook’s AI bots began communicating with one another in a language that humans couldn’t understand, puzzling their creators. Similar confusion ensued when Amazon’s Alexa devices began spontaneously laughing at their owners’ requests. AI complex algorithms may result in outcomes that surpass human understanding. If that happens, no one will be able to predict its next move.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 749]: Aside from creating jobs for around 100K people worldwide , Musk has put his own money on the line to ensure his employees continue to have jobs. In fact, he invested $20 million into saving Tesla after it was on the cusp of bankruptcy in 2015, and he has never taken a paycheck from the company. Additionally, $100 million of his own money went into funding SpaceX – a risky investment, as the space industry had never been privatized before. He has quietly donated to charities and has reportedly pledged to give away at least half of his money when he dies. More recently, he has made his Starlink technology available to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 2937]: Even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity. There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1369]: The argument that internet news tends to offer small passages of text compared to newspapers is to be liberal with the truth, due to the vast nature of the internet it offers a variety of styles and is arguably more likely to provide longer passages than newspapers as there is not space restriction as there is with newspapers which can only be a certain size, due to advertisements and printing agreements. With the ability to both search for and easily share content via social networks, the argument that newspapers are better as they prevent information overload feels weak because there are many ways in which content can be filtered to ensure that both the news you actually want and the style and perspective you prefer can be easily accessed.\n",
            "[Doc 4062]: Schools are communities that not only emphasize collective learning but also encourage sports and creativity in the form of extra curricular activities; such activities serve as a utility to instill societal values into the next generation. These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",
            "[Doc 350]: Conservatives have long disagreed with the mainstream media’s liberal tilt . But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted. Not only does this stop conservatives from challenging their own perspective , it also limits their ability to persuade and engage others. For instance, while the majority of Americans were taking efforts to ward off exposure to the coronavirus, a small minority ( 12% ), many of whom reportedly watched Fox News, weren’t concerned, mirroring the station’s initial lackadaisical coverage of the pandemic. Having an additional viewpoint is positive but creating a bubble (a phenomenon present on both sides of the partisan divide) is not.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1030]: America is built on a capitalist pyramid, and Wall Street employees are resting on the top. When joining a major firm straight out of college, analysts can make an easy $85,000 a year before bonuses , and managing directors can top an annual salary of $450,000. In 2017, Wall Street employees took home an average of $140,000 in bonuses – an even higher amount than the previous year. It’s no surprise, then, that employee satisfaction across Wall Street firms has recently been at an all-time high . For those who are willing to put in those grueling 12-hour days , working on Wall Street is a direct manifestation of the American dream.\n",
            "[Doc 1175]: The stock market works thanks to the liquidity Wall Street firms provide. It’s easy for people to buy and sell securities, because bank traders will facilitate the process. When the market is hot, companies can use their stock to raise capital. The money can then be allocated towards increased business investment, which leads to higher economic output . Additionally, Wall Street capital has been used to fund companies in vital industries like technology, which has created many jobs over the years. Without Wall Street, none of these market-based processes would work effectively.\n",
            "[Doc 859]: The information that Wall Street traders are privy to creates an economic imbalance between traders and the average Joe. Traders are more well-informed about the stock market, and as a result, they stack the market against the lay investor. They get large shares of stocks with low, early prices, which means that anyone without inside information has to pay a slightly higher price for the same stock. Overall, Wall Street bonuses are around double the total earnings of Americans who work full-time jobs at minimum wage, proving that the financial deck is stacked in Wall Street’s favor. The movie The Big Short reveals – and explains – this exact dichotomy, and how Wall Street hedge funders used their unique insight to their advantage, profiting off the bursting housing bubble .\n",
            "[Doc 544]: “The other 99% ” (people who don’t fall into the wealth bracket of the rich) may not like the gap between the rich and the poor that Wall Street has come to represent, but they need Wall Street all the same. It loans savers’ money to businesses in need, allows for credit card transactions, and provides small investors with opportunities to buy low-cost stocks. Society can’t survive without banks and bankers ( Bitcoin is still far from replacing them), which play critical roles in channeling savings into investments. Because of Wall Street, we have a system that we can trust to handle our money properly.\n",
            "[Doc 785]: Wall Street firms have spent over a combined $150 million per year in an effort to influence political policy . A study by the Federal Reserve Bank showed that there’s a “revolving door” between financial executives and government regulators, meaning that regulators can easily become part of the private sectors that they oversee, simply by switching jobs. With the amount of money flowing through Wall Street, it’s easy to see how lobbyists can sway government policy to reflect their best interests. Democracy is supposed to be immune to wealth (or lack thereof), yet with the millions allocated from Wall Street pockets towards lobbying in Washington, that’s clearly not the case.\n",
            "[Doc 2450]: Private Social Security accounts will be a boon to Wall Street, where banks and investment advisors could receive over $100 in fees for each account. Since the number of Social Security beneficiaries is expected to grow to more than 125.7 million by 2090,  Wall Street will have guaranteed access to a rapidly growing pool of customers courtesy of the federal government.\n",
            "[Doc 288]: Movies like Boiler Room and The Wolf of Wall Street hone in on the corruption that can easily worm its way into the Wall Street lifestyle. They depict unqualified “brokers” using high-pressure sales tactics to convince unsuspecting civilians to invest with them, usually by giving them false information about various stocks. The brokers become millionaires, and the people who invest with them often lose their money. Unfortunately, these movies aren’t works of imaginative fiction; The W olf of Wall Street is based on a true story , and there are many examples of real-life corruption among Wall Street’s banks. For instance, JPMorgan Chase paid $410 million in penalties for manipulating electricity markets in California in 2013. Additionally, that same year, $5.6 billion was paid by six major banks in response to allegations that their investment banking traders tried to manipulate foreign exchange rates. More recently, in December 2019, Goldman Sachs began talks with the US government about a possible $2 billion settlement and a potential admission of guilt over their alleged role in a Malaysian corruption scandal.\n",
            "[Doc 4010]: Another point the proposition could have made but did not is that Wall street is pushing for privatization of pension funds: The opposition's answer:The only reason the U.S financial services industry has favored private pension funds is because Wall Street can make huge brokerage fees(incl. premiums) on the billions of dollars that will be invested in private accounts. The N.P.V(net present value) of payments of financial fees to private companies in the case of privatizing securities will be a dramatic profit of $940 billion over 75 years. However, such funds can never benefit the ordinary citizens of the U.S and other market-based economies. For the sole reason that it is too risky. While and we have said this before; for economies that are largely bank-based the market and thus private pension funds play a rather unimportant insignificant role in terms of citizen welfare. As companies/schemes/funds rise and fall based on their relations with prominent banks and not on the ups and downs of markets; in a market economy once pension funds are privatized wall street benefits, the public is duped and most(if not all) of us are victimized by financial scams of the kind noted earlier. The market is unpredictable; we the citizens of these nations are not equipped with the financial expertise required to handle our own finances. Wall street is wary of the tricks of the trade and how to bend the rules to favor finance gurus. Betting on two opposite future outcomes is one such tactic. If everyone was taught finance in school things would be different; however, that is not presently the case. We can not set the public up for disasters it has faced in the past, that too not at an old-weak age; knowing that the factors contributing to the dismal effects of free Marketisation/Marketization still exist.\n",
            "[Doc 3835]: Another question to argue about is that, is it moral to use death-row prisoners as guinea pigs for medical experiment? The propostion never showed us why it's morally justified to do so. To force anyone to be experimented for medical research without their informed consent is both illegal and immoral. Medical ethics requires doctors or pharmacautical companies to conduct their experiments with the informed consent from patients or volunteers, which means that an individual should be fully informed about the potential harms or benefits an experiments would like to bring. We think there's no point that such a basic moral principle could be tramped, this should be applied equally to both general public and prisoners, for the latter group although being deprived of their freedom or life, there's no justification why they also deprived the right to manage their own body. It should be a basic working ethics abide by doctors and pharmacautical manufactures.\n",
            "[Doc 2486]: Senior teachers choose to teach more resource-rich and less challenging populations instead of the classrooms that would benefit the most from experienced teachers. Public Agenda President Deborah Wadsworth argues that teacher tenure leads to \"a distribution of talent that is flawed and inequitable.”\n",
            "[Doc 2050]: While it is true that crime is correlated with people coming from poorer socio-economic backgrounds this does not in itself prove that poverty itself is the cause of crime. A lack of education or bad parenting might be equally, if not more convincing explanations for both phenomena. The causation may even be reversed, with those who indulge in violent behaviour and who seek illegal short-cuts to success rather than being prepared to hold down a steady job being more likely to end up poor. For example, recent studies have found that street-level drug dealers make less than the minimum wage. In order to tackle crime, therefore, we don’t need to eradicate poverty, but improve people’s internalization of social norms through law enforcement and education.\n",
            "[Doc 3450]: Although it might seem a bit vacuous, virtue ethics states that when we act righteously we become more complete persons. Thus the most moral action for ourselves, would be to help others and, in doing so, become more virtuous persons.\n",
            "[Doc 1475]: One of the most important factors of oppression of women’s rights, particularly in the developing world, is dependence . Women are often confined to the home by force, lack of opportunity or social stigma, on behalf of their husbands. When she is not paid, a housewife must rely on her husband for money, especially if she has children she is expected to take care of. Economic empowerment allows further freedom for women in countries where women are confined to the home . By making women economic actors, you empower them to engage in different social structures and hold a stake and position in the centres of economic power. This is the most empowering tool one can offer women in most countries around the world . By paying housewives for their work, you offer one of the most powerful forms of social empowerment for women around the world. Women's Work and Economic Empowerment .

            "[Doc 2092]: Western dominance leads to economic policies and loan conditions rooted in neoliberal economic principles, like austerity measures, which overemphasize cutting public spending. These often actually end up badly hurting developing economies, increasing inequalities and poverty (Malawi is a prominent example) . Argentina’s economic collapse attests to that . The IMF itself should be on trial”.\n",
            "[Doc 2204]: Navigating past the wall will be a problem that people trying to cross the border or bring drugs through the border will have to face. It will create apprehension from attempting to do so. It will make it harder for these crossings to occur.\n",
            "[Doc 3946]: If teachers get merit pay for the success of their students,then they will strive harder in order to yield successful individuals. And that would greatly help for the success of its nation. Teachers are not just getting into school to teach but also to learn and to study for the betterment of their discussion so that their students would also be interested to learn and be important.\n",
            "[Doc 3172]: The difference, intellectually and morally, between man and the rest of the animal kingdom is vast. Unlike animals, who are pre-programmed to act in certain ways (we call it \"instinct\"), man is a creature of self-awareness (conciousness) and thus, unlike animals, is aware of the variety of choices available to him in any situation that requires a choice be made. Therefore, this makes him a creature of volition (free will). The example of a man being prompted to cross the street by a green light in order to prove that man acts as a robotic entity and not as a creature of free will is faulty. What about the person who encounters a red light at an intersection and chooses to ignore it and cross the street anyway? Or, what about the person who encounters the green light, understands that they can now cross the street because the green light says so, but does not do so because a speeding car approaches, which causes that person to decide that it would not be safe to cross the street, and they hold back because the car may not stop but proceed through the intersection instead? In either of these cases, these people had a range of choices. They could have chosen to jay-walk, for example! The \"green light\" argument above, which attempts to prove that people are not creatures of free will because the person is \"determined\" to cross the street, is simply faulty. To be \"determined\" in something is itself an act of volition (free will), and we can choose our level of \"determination\". We can be somewhat determined or greatly determined to do (or not do) something. One could argue that we do share in common some instincts with animals, such as the instinct towards self-preservation. However, even in this case, we know there are many examples of people who have deliberately ignored their own \"instinct\" towards self-preservation, and instead deliberately sacrifice themselves for a cause or a person or group of people. An example would be a soldier who deliberately throws himself over a grenade that is about to explode in order to save his comrades from a certain death. Unlike animals, man has surpassed acting on purely instinct, is a creature of awareness, and because of his greatly superior intellect and the ability to choose between actions with understanding of what the possible outcomes could be, makes him a creature of free will.\n",
            "[Doc 3804]: At the core of a legalized physician assisted suicide (PAS) system is the principal that medical ethics should be governed and regulated by the professionals instead of lawmakers. A PAS system puts the expertise of the doctor and the experience of the patient at the forefront of the issue and views both perspectives rightly as the most credible in a given situation. The law cannot adapt to the specificity and multitude of ethical problems that arise on a situational basis. The law can only take into account circumstances that it foresees and can elaborate on. The highly personal and situational nature of this issue deems it insufficient for legislation, which exists outside the realm of the personal. The foundation of medical ethics relies upon the understanding of the consent (when applicable) of the patient to the procedure and the discretion, judgment, and experience of the medical profession to whom the patient has entrusted their care. The basis of good and ethical health and health systems relies upon the integrity of this.\n",
            "[Doc 655]: Bitcoin is catching on, regardless of any personal aversion to it. It is already considered as one of the world’s top currencies and is becoming more and more mainstream; Elon Musk’s Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in 2021 while certain colleges even accept it as payment. In fact, there are reports that JPMorgan , among others on Wall Street, are accepting Bitcoin as an asset class.

            "[Doc 971]: One of the main reasons Stalin launched the ‘second economic revolution’ of 1928-1941 was his desire to build a socialist economic system and turn the Soviet Union into a great power .

The plans eventually lead to increased output and great economic development.\n",

            "[Doc 1157]: More than poking fun at individuals, trolls mock media-driven culture at large, often times exposing glaring inefficiencies. Trolls reveal media’s propensity for sensationalism (and sometimes, a concerning lack of fact-checking) by getting mainstream news outlets to pick up fake stories. For example, ABC’s “Good Morning America” ran a story which claimed that Kanye West fans do not know who Paul McCartney is . More recently, the controversy surrounding Russia’s role in using trolls to spread fake news to interfere with the 2016 presidential elections has forced internet users to question what they read. Trolls thusly warn us be more cautious consumers of information, whether dealing with outlets big or small.\n",
            "[Doc 431]: The line between trolling and cyberbullying is paper thin. All too often, trolling goes beyond mere provocation, and becomes personal, mean, or downright threatening. Studies have shown that women in entertainment and media bear the brunt of such cyber abuse . Ghostbusters’ star Leslie Jones took a very public hiatus from Twitter after trolls drowned her account in an onslaught of racist and sexually explicit posts. They also created an impersonator account from which they spewed vitriol of all manner. Celebrities are certainly not the only people to suffer abuse from internet trolls. The wide repertoire of tactics trolls use to demean and harm their victims – from doxing (releasing an internet user’s contact details) to leading online shame campaigns – leads to real damage that cannot be dismissed as mere fun and games.\n",
            "[Doc 1025]: Trolls do everything for the lulz – the joy of laughing at another person’s expense. A psychology study of self-identified trolls found that people who deemed themselves “trolls” scored high levels of sadism and psychopathy on a personality test. This is not to say that only certain personality types troll. One study found that certain conditions (and not personality types) predispose people to trolling: if a thread of comments begins with a trolling comment, if a person is in a bad mood, or if it is simply the start of the work-week, people are more likely to troll. By propagating negativity, trolling brings out not only the worst in individuals, but in the entire online community.\n",
            "[Doc 1590]: In some instances, when artists achieve success they face the enervating impulse that their achievement brings. They become satisfied and complacent with what they have, robbing them of their demiurgic drive. Worse, and more frequently, successful artists become embroiled in defending their work from pirates, downloaders, and other denizens of the internet. The result is artists wasting time in court, fighting lawsuits that sap them of time to actually focus on creating new works. Artists should be incentivized to look forward, not spend their time clinging to what they have already made. Obviously, they have a right to profit from their work to an extent, which is why a certain, reduced length of copyright is still important. But clearly the current length is far too great as artists retain their copyright until their death and many years after. Moreover once the artist has died it is difficult to see how copyright can be considered to be enhancing or even rewarding creativity; it simply becomes a negative weight on others creativity.\n",
            "[Doc 211]: A reader’s perception and comprehension of a text are easily swayed by the tone of its comments section. As one study noted: “uncivil comments not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant’s interpretation of the news story itself.” Researchers have dubbed this phenomenon “ The Nasty Effect,” and it gives trolls incredible leverage in shaping opinions across the internet (and the world). And trolls don’t always use this power responsibly. Many a troll has discovered that their attention-getting tactics are highly profitable , and deliberately peddle fake news items to bait readers and please advertisers.\n",
            "[Doc 1262]: The internet is an enabler and so has little value on its own. It is not therefore access to the internet that is the human right it is access to information. The internet is obviously useful for this but it is not essential. If someone was denied access to the internet while being locked in a library would he or she really have had any right to information infringed? In such a case the only argument for a right to the internet is that it faster to access the information through the internet than it would be to look it up in the books that are all around. There cannot therefore be considered to be a right to the internet even as part of any right to information because the right to information would simply require that a government provides access to this information not that it has to be via the internet. Moreover as an enabling technology it is quite possible that the internet may at some point be out of date and replaces by some new method of storing information. As something that is transitory it does not make sense to consider there to be any kind of inalienable right to the internet.\n",
            "[Doc 1618]: Artists as they are often not paid for anything else may rely on their creative output to support themselves. This is certainly no crime, and existing copyright laws recognize this fact. Artists often rely wholly on their ability to sell and profit from their work. This policy serves to drain them of that potential revenue, as their work is shunted into creative commons, and available to all. Artists often also have families to support, and putting the added financial burden on them of stripping them of their copyright only serves to further those problems as they exist. A robust system of copyright is a much better protection to struggling and successful artists alike who like all talented individuals seek to assuage their material wants. Artists cannot live on appreciation alone. With much less secure copyright many would have to find other work.\n",
            "[Doc 1593]: Artists may rely on their creative output to support themselves. This is certainly no crime, and existing copyright laws recognize this fact. Artists rarely have pensions of the sort that people in other professions have as they are rarely employed by anyone for more than a short period. They also recognize the need of artists to be able to support their dependents, many of whom too rely on the artist’s output. In the same way financial assets like stocks can be bequeathed to people for them to profit, so too must copyright be. Copyright is a very real asset and financial protection that should be sustained for the sake of artists’ financial wellbeing and that of their loved ones.\n",
            "[Doc 845]: Not all trolls wield negativity as their weapon of choice. Some trolls use their art to spread joy and light-hearted humor . Named one of Time Magazine’s most influential people on the internet, Ken M , has been peppering comments sections with off-beat, uniformed, and hilarious remarks for years. His humorous remarks, he says, were initially a response to the “ toxic ” negativity he found in Yahoo’s comments sections. Hollywood celebrity couple Ryan Reynolds and Black Lively have taken trolling to a whole new, romantic level, letting fans in on their habit of trolling each other in good, humorous fun. In this way, troll comedy can unite and inspire others to also make lemonade out of the digital world’s lemons.\n",
            "[Doc 1614]: The nature of the internet and mass media on the 21st century is such that many artists can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them. Wider use by other artists and laymen alike helps artistic works “go viral” and to gain major impact that allow the artist to generate a name for his or herself and to attain the levels of earnings conventional copyrights are meant to help artists generate but that ultimately hamstring them. A major example of this is the band Nine Inch Nails, which opted in 2008 to begin releasing its albums through the creative commons. After all, the artists still retain control of the commercial uses of their work and are guaranteed under creative commons licensing regulations to be credited by users of their content. The state should thus facilitate the sharing by mandating the distribution of art of all kinds under creative commons licenses.\n",
            "[Doc 3933]: In this case, we are thinking of a young child accessing the internet. They can do this with or without permission from their parents. When internet privacy is enhanced, it becomes difficult for predators to seek out young children online. These people may wish to manipulate them into doing awful things. Besides that, those with mental disabilities are also protected with internet privacy. People who may wish to use their mental illness to exploit them for money or sexually cannot do that with internet privacy.\n",

In fact, some of the rioters who stormed the US Capitol building in 2021 were fired from their jobs after internet-sleuths found them online and publicized their identities . Casual social media users have long used social media as a tool to offer police agencies tips based on posts that allude to – or brag about – criminal activity. In this way, crowd-sleuthing harnesses the internet’s power of centralized information to provide a little extra protection for us all.\n",

            "[Doc 181]: Ignoring artists’ wrongdoings gives them legitimacy to continue their unethical and illegal actions. On a smaller scale, we might glorify a rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle that teens will emulate as a result, but this debate doesn’t stop at trashing hotel rooms. As long as rapists, racists and murderers are still being lauded for their work, and artists keep getting the recognition they want, then we, as a society, will be paving the path for others to do the same. Case in point: It has taken more than 2 decades for R Kelly to face legal consequences for his sexual misconduct. Would Michael Jackson still be considered the king of pop had we seen Leaving Neverland earlier? If we stop consuming art by abusers, perhaps other artists will think twice before doing something illegal or behaving unethically.\n",

So, no T.V or internet at all, is not the answer. As far as porn is concerned most boys are peer-pressured into viewership; there is a wealth of parental control software available to block sites that teenagers/children cannot unblock without using secret passwords that only parents know. Using Proxies to access these sites can also be prevented. Either way; it isn't too difficult to insure that your child is not misusing or over-using the internet.\n",
            "[Doc 1726]: Given that the Internet is used as an international , the government has no right over the information which may be presented via the Internet. In Western liberal democracies, governments are elected on the basis by which they can serve their own country – how they will create or maintain laws that pertain specifically to that nation, and how they will govern the population. The Internet is not country-specific, but international and free. As such, no individual government should have a right to the information on it. Asserting false authority over the internet would paint the government as dictatorial and a ‘nanny state’ , demonstrating a lack of respect for its citizens by assuming that they cannot protect themselves or recognise the nature of extremist or potentially harmful sites and take the individual decision to distance themselves from such sites.\n",
            "[Doc 3938]: Whether it is planning the next terror plot or planning a bank heist, the only people who benefit from the internet privacy are criminals. While it does have some benefits for everyone else, criminals benefit disproportionality for it. They are able to manipulate it and thus stay off the radar of law enforcement. As more tools continue to develop for improving internet privacy, so do the likelihood of successful criminal activity. In short, if you have nothing to hide, internet privacy should not be such a concern to you. Law enforcers have enough training to know not to misuse any information they gather about your private life on the internet.\n",
            "[Doc 1598]: When the experience of the internet differs between people because of their backgrounds and past activities, the position of the online experience as one free of informational prejudice is undermined. It is important that the internet and the sites and services that float around it be as free from external prejudicing that contemporary targeted marketing creates. This marketing shapes at the most basic level the internet experience people interact with, and as it differs between people the quality of the universal service is diminished in a way. The internet should remain a neutral space.\n",
            "[Doc 1321]: The internet is a means of communication – therefore also a means of communication between criminals. And because it is global it creates global crime problems that need coordinated responses. One type of crime that has particularly become a problem on the internet is child sexual abuse material: the internet allows for an easy and anonymous distribution method which can even be secured by modern encryption methods.\n",

An internet troll is someone who intentionally and aggressively harasses people online with disruptive, offensive, or inflammatory comments. According to Miller, trolls can often exhibit deeper, darker traits linked to antisocial behavior, aggression, and cyberbullying. The same behaviors that fuel cyberbullies—hate speech, doxxing, misinformation—are frequently present in internet trolls and are linked to specific personality traits. “Constructs like psychopathy and narcissism and even sadism are pretty regularly linked to online trolling behaviors,” Miller says. The ability to hide behind a pseudonym and encrypted networks gives internet trolls the security they need to act out against real people, from bullying your neighbors to insulting or even threatening celebrities and politicians. It’s harder for an internet troll to act out this behavior in the real world, where jailtime or a simple punch in the face might be the consequences. “However, research suggests that those who consistently troll others online are often difficult people offline, too.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 965]: Most of Gates’s time is spent focused on giving, rather than on accumulating wealth. One of his greatest accomplishments to date is the creation of The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation charity, to which he recently donated $4.6 billion . The Foundation’s efforts are mainly in tackling global healthcare in both developing and first-world countries, although the richest charity in the world doesn’t discriminate when it comes to helping the needy. Gates has also generously donated to a number of other initiatives dedicated to bettering the planet. He backed the Omniprocessor , a machine which converts human excrement into usable electricity and drinking water, with the goal of giving people around the world proper sanitation . His campaign The Youth Grand Challenges encourages teenagers and young adults to explore scientific innovation, while The Misk Grand Challenges tackle global development problems. Gates has a plan to change many aspects of the world – and he’s certainly putting his money where his mouth is.\n",
            "[Doc 208]: Gates jumped into tech innovation before it was the cool thing to do. As difficult as it is to fathom, he is largely the reason that over 84% of Americans own personal computers today. Gates envisioned “a computer on every desk in every home” back in the 1980’s, and soon afterwards made that vision come to fruition through the creation of Microsoft . From the moment it was founded until now, Gates has ensured that Microsoft has continuously paved the way for technological innovation, revolutionizing the way we communicate, do business, work and play. Microsoft aside, Gates has a track record for spotting opportunity , like repeatedly encouraging and participating in various initiatives within scientific exploration.\n",
            "[Doc 611]: You’d think a man who alone pockets more than the bottom 50% of America’s wealth might have let it get to his head, but Gates remains humble to the bone. Despite being a tech guru, he limits the use of technology in his home, in order to teach his children good values. He and his wife, Melinda, have emphasized that their children won’t be getting the vast majority of their wealth; on national television, Gates explained: “Well, our kids receive a great education and some money, but they will go out and have their own careers….[wealth] distorts anything they might do, and they need to find their own path.”\n",
            "[Doc 1081]: Gates publicly stands for several ideals that directly contradict his lifestyle. Joining a list of other prominent billionaires, he famously spoke out against capitalism , criticizing the lack of attention paid to the poor and scientific innovation by the wealthy. This can be construed as hypocritical on Gates’s part; while he and Melinda have pledged billions towards philanthropy, given that capitalism has given them their billions in the first place, it’s a bit difficult to crown him the champion of the socialist cause. No one is denying his charitable donations, but appointing himself the spokesperson of poverty and income inequality seems ironic at best.\n",
            "[Doc 92]: Because of his extensive donations to international projects, Gates has immense control over global health. His charitable Foundation contributes 10% of the World Health Organization ’s total budget, putting himself in a place to wield undue influence on the organization’s policies. Any individual with that much influence over an entire sector is concerning, as he shapes everything from the conversation surrounding global health to the decisions on which diseases to allocate what resources. The Foundation also has a multitude of partnerships with companies in the private sector involved in global health governance. This creates huge conflicts of interest when it comes to policy-making. Gates isn’t a doctor nor practiced in medicine, yet his opinions on global health are the ones that decide its future.\n",
            "[Doc 1950]: The government is here to serve the people. The concept behind a referendum is public sovereignty, the people themselves are the ones who get to decide. Having had one referendum it has already been agreed that this is an issue where it should not be up to our representatives in Parliament to decide, rather it is an issue for direct democracy. Having started the issue, the people have a right to determine the result. In Parliament there is not just a single vote on an issue. Rather there are three readings of a bill in each house. Then there is consideration of amendments from the house that did not initiate the bill often with parliamentary ping pong. Throughout this MPs get multiple opportunities to vote, both on the whole bill and on individual amendments.\n",
            "[Doc 1625]: Homophobia in Uganda was not introduced by this law. Refusing to sign the bill into law would result in increased brutality and cruelty to the LGBT minority from the majority of citizens who were angry that president Museveni even considered vetoing the bill. Shortly after the president’s letter to parliament requesting the shelving of the bill was revealed, thousands of Ugandans took on to the streets protesting against the move complaining that homosexuality will never be allowed in their society. Known gay Ugandans were forced not to move while others were attacked in their homes. Long before the bill was passed by parliament, homosexuals and LGBT activists were beaten, harassed and killed by their fellow Ugandans. David Kato a leading figure in demanding equal rights for the gay minority was killed in January 2011. The situation may have worsened had the bill been shelved as angry Ugandans would attack the gay community seeking revenge, something that they made clear would happen during the anti-gay protests. Most Ugandans had supported a death penalty for homosexuals and clearly have few qualms about launching attacks, sometimes murderous against homosexuals.\n",
            "[Doc 59]: The rich , by definition, have a lot of money. In fact, the top 1 percent in the US holds 15 times more wealth than the bottom 50 percent combined. Meanwhile, 34 million Americans live in poverty, with half a million homeless on any given night. Even with higher tax rates (and fewer loopholes), the country’s wealthiest will be fine; billionaires like Bill Gates and conservative Mark Cuban, among others, attest to this, having said they would be willing to pay more in taxes. For the government to provide basic housing, nourishment, health care and education to the rest of its citizens, the money must come from somewhere. For the most fortunate to fail to pay their fair share would be a moral failure.\n",
            "[Doc 2328]: What this bill allows is for the facts to be taught and then seen through the lens of various theories. The bill requires that the schools within the state remain within the state science curriculum. It “protects the teaching of scientific information, and shall not be construed to promote any religious or non-religious doctrine”. The result therefore is that this Tennessee law opens up academic enquiry and science rather than shutting it down as opponents claim.\n",
            "[Doc 979]: One need only look at the world’s current industry idols to see why jumping into the workforce right out of high school may be a good idea. Bill Gates , Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg – now household names – dropped out of college to gain work experience, which ultimately started their (extremely successful) careers. Work experience gives you a leg up on future employability and helps you to shape your own career goals. While you may not know exactly which field you’d like to pursue, the soft skills you’ll gain in any job will be crucial to moving you forward in life.

            "[Doc 791]: The years after college are the ones in which you have the highest risk-tolerance of your life. Most recent grads don’t have families to support, and besides for paying off loans and making rent, they’re free to do anything they want – with little consequence if they fail. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and some of the world’s other famous entrepreneurs didn’t even finish college before starting their businesses. As Warren Buffett , one of the most successful business magnates the world has ever seen, says: “Whatever you want to learn more, start doing it today. Don’t put if off to your old age….You’ll have a more rewarding life not only in terms of how much money you make, but how much fun you have out of life; you’ll make more friends the more interesting person you are.”\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 1624]: More than 90% of Uganda’s population believe that homosexuality is not part of their culture and should never be accepted, its seen as  indecency, criminality and a taboo in the community. This is something the government did not invent and not something it can simply wash out of society. Shelving the bill would not suddenly create tolerance from Ugandan society towards the gay community but instead would isolate and impose a threat to the LGBT community. Others would have tried to create laws anti-gay laws. This ‘kill the Gays bill’ was originally intended to include the death penalty for some homosexual acts such as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\". Any wider change to the culture of the country is not the duty of the government.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 934]: The notion that privacy is the natural price of fame is false – even illogical. There are, in fact, plenty of famous people whose private lives are not routinely invaded by the media. Ever seen an article making fun of the Dalai Lama’s “dad bod”? Why has MTV neglected to add mega-philanthropist and billionaire Melinda Gates to its list of celebrity MILFs? Even Hollywood A-listers like Matt Damon and Julia Roberts have managed to avoid the gossip mill. These cases of famous people whose lives are, for the most part, still private , prove that it’s possible for fame to be based on achievement rather than intrigue – and all celebrities should be treated this way.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 2327]: This bill that opens the door to creationism is really about changing the way that teaching is done to make it more critical and analytical. This is an improvement in scientific education as it will help ensure that science is about critical, constructive discourse rather than just imbibing ‘facts’. That would not be education, it would be indoctrination.\n",
            "[Doc 1009]: It may be hard to imagine former president Trump and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or current President Biden and current House Speaker Kevin McCarthy kicking off their shoes after work and knocking back a glass of whiskey together, but that is exactly how Reagan and House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Democrat, ended their day. And his aisle-crossing was not limited to happy hour. His immigration reform bill signed in 1986 allowed amnesty for those who entered the country before 1982. He also worked with O’Neill on a deficit reduction bill that increased taxes . Some of these actions were not popular among Reagan’s base, but they won over the electorate at large. Reagan won both his elections by a landslide, and in his re-election came with the most electoral votes in history. And Americans’ view of the Gipper has only improved with time. He also won over people’s hearts and appreciation by publicly sharing his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in 1994.\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",

Bill Gates’ style of **leadership** might be categorised as one focused on intellectual rigour, the importance of competition, and thinking outside the box. Especially in the early years of Microsoft, Gates was known for his hands-on approach and was involved in various aspects of the company’s operations, from programming to product development. Bill Gates’ leadership style is a blend of intellectual rigour, visionary thinking, competitive drive, and a deep commitment to societal betterment. The lasting impact of Bill Gates’ leadership is multifaceted, reflecting his influential roles in technology, philanthropy, and global health. At Microsoft, Gates’ visionary leadership revolutionised the personal computing landscape. At Microsoft, he revolutionised computing, and later, his work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation emphasised data-driven solutions in global health.

            "[Doc 1176]: Yesterday’s old-school playground bullies tend to hang out online today. But cyberbullying doesn’t just affect kids and teens; adults are also victimized by cyberbullies, especially on Twitter . As users can open and operate multiple fake Twitter accounts, it is easy for anyone to claim to be someone else – impersonating people to either spread fake news or hurt others. In fact, it’s easier to create a fake personality on Twitter than on other social media platforms, since it demands much less visual evidence of users’ private lives. Take feminist writer Lindy West , who was stalked and harassed by a fellow Twitter user pretending to be her deceased dad. Even those who don’t hide behind fake profiles can troll others, taunting users with abusive, racist and anti-Semitic tweets. The former US president himself was also known to make offensive tweets . Even before the Jan. 6 riots , Twitter, which was used by protestors to encourage participation in events that day, had already started making efforts to mitigate cyberbullying and tweets that were perceived to potentially encourage or glorify violence . However, the platform is challenging to monitor; it’s often healthier for innocent victims to close their Twitter accounts.\n",
            "[Doc 1203]: Whether or not you believe a fetus is already a life, it is undeniable that once conception occurs, the potential for life exists . Life is our strongest biological and psychological instinct, serving as the foundation for Maslow’s hierarchy of needs . To many, in a world of uncertainties, the pursuit of life is the only definite. Many people may argue that putting a deliberate end to life goes against our biological and physical existence. Who are we to play God and decide what constitutes life or who deserves to live and die? Who are we to take charge of the future of a totally dependent unborn child and determine that his or her life is not worth living, no matter the circumstances?\n",
            "[Doc 319]: Twitter is direct. Even after extending its original 140-character count to a generous 280 , Twitter’s concise nature makes it the perfect tool for our hectic, non-stop lifestyles. The platform’s focus on succinct tweets – as opposed to the images and videos of pets and gourmet meals that crowd other social platforms – keeps users informed and able to communicate with each other with much less clutter. While 23% of Americans use Twitter, most of the country knows about the platform, even if they don’t use it. This attests to its accessible nature – and the fact that anyone who thinks or types can use it (except for those who have been suspended from it, like Donald Trump and Kanye West .)\n",
            "[Doc 385]: Today, when more people are getting their news from social media than ever before, Twitter is increasingly becoming their first choice. According to the Pew Research Center 69% of adult Twitter users get their news from the site. And 70% of Twitter news users turn to the site to follow live news events. This social media platform has been a lead source into what is happening on the ground during huge and/or tragic events. Its news-related accounts enable regular people to connect directly with journalists ( 80% of whom use Twitter for their jobs). The platform also played a vital role during the pandemic , sharing important information regarding nationwide Covid response updates, new research , and vaccine availability.\n",
            "[Doc 193]: These days, mostly everyone is on Twitter – including your boss or clients. Therefore, misuse of the social channel can devastate your work opportunities and, by extension, your home and community life. (Not to mention any inappropriate behavior offline that’s caught on video may be uploaded to Twitter and shared globally.) Furthermore, unlike other social media platforms, Twitter has allowed your tweets to appear in Google search results since 2015. This means a lot of extra, perhaps unwelcome, exposure for any regrettably or hastily written or spoken sentiments. Take comedian Kevin Hart . He was scheduled to host the 2019 Academy Awards until his homophobic tweets were discovered and got him fired from the gig.\n",
            "[Doc 1889]: Every life presents an inherent value to society. Every individual has the potential to contribute in one way or another, and taking the child's life before it has even had a chance to experience and contribute to the world undermines that potential. Even more, the underlying philosophical claim behind abortion is that not every life is equally valued and if a life is 'unwanted' or 'accidental' it is not worth enough to live. That kind of thinking goes directly against the life-affirming policies and philosophies of most countries, and peoples themselves.\n",
            "[Doc 1022]: Twitter has become an effective platform for kickstarting societal change. The social media platform was instrumental in organizing mass protests in Egypt during the Arab Spring . Michelle Obama also used it to call attention to the abduction – and later return – of 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria with her #BringBackOurGirls campaign . Twitter activism has made especially productive use of hashtags to raise direct awareness of societal matters – on a global scale – and to address and even correct wrongdoings. Additionally, Twitter’s #MeToo phenomenon transformed a Hollywood scandal into a worldwide movement; not only did the platform open a floodgate of consequence , but it has also become a tool to ensure accountability . Plus, through offshoot hashtags , it has nurtured calls for change worldwide.\n",
            "[Doc 1282]: The use of performance enhancing drugs is based on advances in science. When new drugs and therapies are found, athletes turn to them and as a result are much of the time ahead of the anti-doping organizations, which need to develop methods of athlete testing whenever a new drug that is meant to be untraceable is created. In 2008 it was a big shock when Riccardo Ricco (a cyclist) was caught using the performance-enhancing drug Mircera, which had been considered undetectable for a number of years. The fact is that a ban of performance enhancing drugs enables mainly athletes from wealthy countries and teams that can afford the newest technology to go undetected, whilst others are disadvantaged (1). So because it gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy one who can pay for the undetectable drugs, we should legalize it.\n",
            "[Doc 1909]: There exists a basic right to life which, as humans, we try to follow. Killing others is outlawed because we generally believe that every person has the right to live their life and no one else has the right to take that life away. In the situation with the train there are two possible outcomes which both lead to life being cut short. Due to the fact that we place such value on life we have a duty to reduce the number of people who die.

They would argue that suicide is never justified, even if the reasons might appear to be good. It is impossible to sacrifice your life for others, because you cannot know how important your life is to others in relation to how important other people’s lives are. Either life is invaluable and it is thus impossible to value one life higher than others, or it can be valued, but it is impossible for us to assess our life’s value in relation to others. Therefore, while we accept that some might die, it is not for the individual to take matters into his or her own hands and accelerate the process, as this decision might be made on the wrong grounds, but cannot be reversed.\n",
            "[Doc 226]: By definition, death is the cessation of life – so, by all logic, there is no life after death. In this vein, physics professor Sean Carroll contends that life after death is impossible. While there are many things we don’t know about the world, he says, we do know about the particles that make up the human body – and those don’t go anywhere after the body dies. Because consciousness is part of the physical body, it dies along with the rest of a person. Unlike other uncertainties in life, this concept is relatively straightforward: With death, life ends.\n",

None of the so called evidence proving extraterrestrial life exist has been acknowledged as accurate by credible professionals in the field of science. the scientist cannot agree there is no solid proof, scientist base their claims on sound proof and no such evidence proving extraterrestrials life exist. Most of the evidence claiming that aliens exist comes from uncertified, uncredible individuals who are on a wild goose chase.

Effect sizes were comparable to the effect of social interactions on well-being. Does Twitter affect health?

Why do people use Twitter so much? The study states that “people who used Twitter a lot were lonelier and more bored; people who retweeted a lot were more polarised; people who used Twitter to avoid their problems (escapism) had lower wellbeing and higher outrage levels; and people who used Twitter for social interactions had a higher sense of belonging”.

With the definition of terrorist groups highly dependent on the goals of each individual government, it’s easy to imagine how drone warfare could devolve into a free-for-all. Another example: the use and availability of drones are increasing casualties and intensities of regional clashes in areas like Armenia and Azerbaijan that, until now, have been limited by such countries’ inability to wage air campaigns. On a larger scale, a 2022 deadly drone attack in the middle of Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels may mean an escalation of violence in an already volatile region. And let’s not forget about Syria, where the US and Russia are supporting opposing sides.

As we can see, it hasn't happened - and in fact the opposite idea is now prevalent. The current climate change scare is just a repeat of the 1970s. Furthermore, does anyone remember chlorofluorocarbons? Those really did damage the environment: most notably the ozone layer. The papers were flooded with the idea that the ozone layer would be stripped away irreparably and we had well and truly destroyed our own planet. Except that it's now closing.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1065]: Extracting natural gas through fracking has dire environmental consequences. A 2014 study on the environmental costs and benefits of fracking claims that fracking could potentially release toxic chemicals into the air and water, in addition to contaminating drinking water through surface spills and other means. Wastewater disposal – a byproduct of fracking that gets injected into the ground – is partially responsible for a hundredfold increase in man-made earthquakes, threatening 3.5 million people a year. Additionally, there is evidence that fracking causes severe methane leaks , which traps heat in our atmosphere and can be devastating for the climate.\n",
            "[Doc 276]: In the last few years, vast reserves of resources like oil and gas have suddenly been made available due to the creation of cost-effective extraction techniques, like fracking, which are completely transforming the US’s perspective on energy. Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006. This significantly reduced the price of gas and created a huge boom in domestic oil production.\n",
            "[Doc 353]: Until recently, coal was responsible for over 50% of the US’s electricity generation. But this dipped to less than 37% in 2012 thanks to fracking; America’s carbon emissions have dropped over 800 million tons as a result, which might help reduce the effects of climate change. Burning natural gases (made possible by fracking) instead of coal cuts almost every kind of air pollutant and C02 from the atmosphere, resulting in fewer harmful particles in the air.\n",
            "[Doc 410]: Fracking technology has rejuvenated local economies and provided job security for people previously unemployed. Between 2005 and 2012, over 725,000 jobs were created thanks to the introduction of fracking, which reduced the US unemployment rate by 0.5%. A nationwide study found that communities benefit monetarily from having drilling sites in the vicinity, showing an average income increase of 6% and a 10% increase in employment for said communities. While having drilling sites nearby could be seen as a hassle, the economic benefits to surrounding communities makes it worth the inconvenience.\n",
            "[Doc 1072]: Fracking isn’t the only source to tap for energy, and therefore isn’t necessary. Unlike finite resources like fossil fuels and shale rock, which eventually run out and negatively impact the environment, renewable energy sources regenerate and can be used continuously. For example, solar energy takes sunlight and allows it to be used for electricity, hot water, heat, etc. A study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment ranked fracking between 4th-8th place in sustainability when compared to other energy resources. In comparison, renewable energy significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is the cleaner pathway to energy consumption.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant. What would you do in order to get the heart or lung they needed? If no organs were available I bet you’d be begging someone on life-support to give theirs. This scheme takes away that.\n",
            "[Doc 3114]: By entitling families to only two children, we would be secure in the knowledge that there are only so many of us capable of causing negative effects to the environment and from a utilitarian perspective, that there are fewer people to be affected when global warming hits. If all families had two children who were aware of the justifications for their existence in pairs, people would be conditioned from birth to preserve the environment. The extent of the problem would be epitomised by the limited sizes of families.\n",
            "[Doc 3424]: Many people in developed countries believe that as those who are more fortunate-who have been blessed to live in a safe country that isn't going through a civil war or extreme poverty-they have a duty to help those who are in dire situations. This argument is approached from the perspective of basic humanity: if there are people whose lives have been torn apart with their homes being bombed, family members dying, and facing hunger on a daily basis, how can we ignore them and not do our part to help them?\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 886]: While fracking may have created job security for some, it has economic ramifications for communities surrounding the drilling sites. There are no laws in place to protect property owners, and the community members don’t have a say – or a warning – when drilling projects pop up around their houses. This introduces increased noise pollution, light pollution and traffic. As a result of these disruptions, property values in the vicinity of drilling sites often decrease dramatically. Even the former CEO of Exxon (one of the largest oil and gas corporations in America), Rex Tillerson, claimed that drilling would do “ irreparable harm ” to his property value, and he sued a water supply corporation to stop construction of a water tower that was being built to supply drilling operations in the vicinity.\n",
            "[Doc 2937]: Even if we think the terrorist cause is illegitimate we have a moral duty to respect a basic level of humanity. There are certain acts, such as torture, to which no individual should be subjected, regardless of their own behaviour. The Geneva Convention is about universal respect for human dignity (International Committee of the Red Cross, 1949). Civilised nations can and should be expected to act in a humane manner, regardless of the barbarity of one’s adversaries. Respecting them as a human being is a simple moral obligation that has brought us to where we are today. The idea of torturing them is primitive and brings us down to their level. You have to understand that they plan on either killing or being killed when they are in the terrorist mindset, and that by completing their task for them is just granting their wish. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Its relative and all depends on perspective.\n",
            "[Doc 3412]: Some people argue that it's important for children to have a broad awareness about religions. They believe that it will help them make an informed decision on the religion they would like to believe in and understand it, as opposed to only learning about religion at home. Many people who argue for religious education in school curriculums feel that they would have liked to have been offered an option as children about what to believe and to have been able to learn about the different religions that exist. The argument for children understanding about all religions is that they can have a more logical and well-rounded perspective on faith and religious beliefs so that they can choose to think and what they want to believe, for themselves, instead of it being something that they are taught as a fundamental fact by their parents.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n",
            "[Doc 1369]: The argument that internet news tends to offer small passages of text compared to newspapers is to be liberal with the truth, due to the vast nature of the internet it offers a variety of styles and is arguably more likely to provide longer passages than newspapers as there is not space restriction as there is with newspapers which can only be a certain size, due to advertisements and printing agreements. With the ability to both search for and easily share content via social networks, the argument that newspapers are better as they prevent information overload feels weak because there are many ways in which content can be filtered to ensure that both the news you actually want and the style and perspective you prefer can be easily accessed.\n",
            "[Doc 4062]: Schools are communities that not only emphasize collective learning but also encourage sports and creativity in the form of extra curricular activities; such activities serve as a utility to instill societal values into the next generation. These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.\n",
            "[Doc 350]: Conservatives have long disagreed with the mainstream media’s liberal tilt . But before the launch of Fox News, they were at least forced to engage with the news seen by a major share of Americans. With many right-leaning viewers now getting their information from Fox News (along with the rise of partisan online media sites), though, they are not exposed to the viewpoints many Americans take for granted. Not only does this stop conservatives from challenging their own perspective , it also limits their ability to persuade and engage others. For instance, while the majority of Americans were taking efforts to ward off exposure to the coronavirus, a small minority ( 12% ), many of whom reportedly watched Fox News, weren’t concerned, mirroring the station’s initial lackadaisical coverage of the pandemic. Having an additional viewpoint is positive but creating a bubble (a phenomenon present on both sides of the partisan divide) is not.\n",
            "[Doc 1550]: One can conceive of an infinite amount of cases in which results of a think tank’s research are completely independent of their funders. Their opposition, however, will be likely to signal corruption, when in fact there may be no relation between a funder and certain results. Even if they are associated by sharing a perspective or an aim, this is not a sign of corruption or bias, and it should not enter into the value of a think tank. There has been one study of charity donations (as think tanks are) that concludes that anonymous donations are “a costly signal of a charity’s quality by an informed donor”.\n",
            "[Doc 1619]: Being able to learn and teach in our own language will preserve the culture of large immigrant groups as part of another state, this is both good for that community and for the nation. For the community and the individual speaking and learning their own language will give immigrants a sense of belonging. They are part of a community that they know and understand because it speaks the same language even before they come to know the rest of the country. This provides security, belonging, and close contact with relatives. For the community it means keeping their own customs and identity alive, in a few cases this may actually be contributing to conserving a language. For the country as a whole this does not represent a threat as there can be many different levels of identity that all intermix. Instead it provides an opportunity; it diversifies the country. It gains the benefit of a different perspective on problems and new ideas as people who speak different languages think about things in different ways so it is useful for innovation to have many different communities brought up in different languages interacting.\n",

The treaty further seeks to guarantee non-nuclear states’ access to peaceful, energy-producing nuclear technology.\n",
            "[Doc 389]: The burning of fossil fuels has been fingered as a main cause of global warming. Without a doubt, nuclear energy has a critical role to play in curbing the carbon emissions that accelerate global warming and climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear energy is an emissions-free, climate neutral power source. NASA predicts that broadening the use of nuclear energy can save between 4 million and 7 million lives by 2050. Unsurprisingly, France and Japan, the world’s biggest nuclear energy consumers, also have the world’s lowest rate of CO2 emissions, demonstrating nuclear energy’s ability to meet their energy demands while helping to make good on its climate commitments . Following the trend, in the spring of 2019, the US signed a deal with India , the world’s third-largest oil buyer, to build six nuclear plants there. Time will tell if this effort to expand nuclear energy over fossil fuels will come to fruition.\n",

Today, there are 16,000 nuclear warheads thanks to the Megatons to Megawatts program, which converted the weapons’ grade uranium found in Russian warheads to nuclear fuel. The program also powered the US with 10% of its energy needs for 20 years – not a bad kickback for ridding the world of 500 tons of highly enriched uranium that would otherwise have been used in weapons of mass destruction. Potentially, the remaining 16,000 warheads could be used to power the entire US for six years. If you’re a fan of disarmament, go nuclear.\n",

There are numerous documented cases of safety mechanisms failing on nuclear weapons, very nearly causing nuclear launches. New proliferating states often have crude security measures and are not as advanced as established nuclear powers, increasing the chance of an accident. Moreover, some nuclear programs are also secretive, decreasing the transparency and ability for groups to scrutinize and criticize the process. Instead of risking a potentially catastrophic accident, nuclear weapons should simply be eliminated.

More than helping to fund the construction for nuclear reactors, the government has also committed the public to fund the nuclear industry’s accidents . Whereas fossil fuel companies are required by law to clean and restore any damage they cause at their own cost, as of 2011, nuclear companies were exempt from responsibility if the damage is too extensive – a strange exception given the fact that nuclear accidents are inevitably more expensive, more dangerous, and farther-reaching than oil spills.\n",

The energy released from nuclear fission is 50 million times more powerful than ordinary chemical reactions, like those produced by burning fossil fuels . The small amount of fuel required to produce vast amounts of energy not only keeps nuclear energy cheap, but it also means that the Earth’s uranium deposits can potentially power humanity for centuries (at current consumption rates).\n",

If this is the case, then a leak’s harm would be limited to the layers of sediment nearby which would be unaffected by radiation. By comparison a leak outside might lead to animals nearby suffering from contamination. Further nuclear waste might reach water sources should there be a leak above ground, if it is raining heavily when the leak happens for example. Further, the other options available, such as above ground storage present a potentially greater danger, should something go wrong. This is because it is much easier for nuclear waste to leak radiation into the air. This is problematic because even a hint of radiation may well cause people to panic owing to the damaging and heavily publicised consequences of previous nuclear safety crises. As such, underground storage is safer both directly and indirectly. Focus and specialisation of this type is much more likely to avert a serious release of nuclear material from an underground facility than the broad and general approach that will be fostered by diverse and distinct above-ground storage solutions. The contributor may be referring to the ejection of irradiated dust and other particulates that has occurred when nuclear power stations have suffered explosive containment failures, but this is not comparable to the types of containment failures that might happen in facilities used to store spent nuclear fuel rods and medical waste. One of the more substantial risks presented by underground storage is release of nuclear material into a water source.\n",
            "[Doc 200]: The raw materials and technology required to generate nuclear energy can be manipulated to produce weapons of mass destruction. Countries like Japan , who have no apparent desire to develop nuclear weapons, nevertheless hang onto stockpiles of plutonium and uranium . Doing so would make it exceedingly easy for them to develop nuclear weapons and set a precedent for other countries to follow. The international “on your honor policies” that govern civil use of nuclear power provide little comfort or security when one considers the volatile countries like Iran , Pakistan and North Korea, which have acquired weapons despite these policies. And let’s not forget India and Pakistan’s increasingly heated tensions over Kashmir. Nuclear energy has the potential to enable its owners to dramatically alter the world order, a worrying prospect for governments and individuals alike.\n",

Over the past fifty years, we have seen a general tendency towards limited warfare and precision weapons, allowing military objectives to be achieved with minimal loss of civilian life. The entire point of nuclear weapons, however, is their massive, indiscriminate destructive power. Their use could kill tens of thousands of civilians directly, and their catastrophic environmental after-effects would harm many more all around the world. These effects could never be morally acceptable, particularly as the basis of one’s national security strategy. They place ‘humanity and most forms of life in jeopardy of annihilation’ (Krieger, 2003). No state or leader can be entrusted, morally, with a power and responsibility that could come close to annihilating humanity.\n",

After World War II, many nuclear disarmament movements and international councils came into being with the purpose of banning these weapons of mass destruction . These organizations led to treaties being signed and sanctions being placed against countries around the world in order to prevent nuclear catastrophe from happening again. Such continued global unity against nuclear weapons still resonates today and has strengthened recent American-led efforts to disarm North Korea.\n",

By comparison a leak outside might lead to animals nearby suffering from contamination. Further nuclear waste might reach water sources should there be a leak above ground, if it is raining heavily when the leak happens for example.

This is problematic because even a hint of radiation may well cause people to panic owing to the damaging and heavily publicised consequences of previous nuclear safety crises. As such, underground storage is safer both directly and indirectly.1 As well as this, underground storage also prevents nuclear waste or nuclear radiation from reaching other states and as such, results in greater safety across borders.2 Further, storing all nuclear waste underground means that countries can concentrate their research and training efforts on responding to subterranean containment failures.

Governments are also faced with the dilemma of whether to spend such an enormous amount of money something which splits public opinion so vociferously. In the meantime, billions are still being spent on decommissioning the old ones. The New Economics Foundation contends that these construction overruns and decommissioning costs are ‘hidden costs’ that are not included in the official statistics meaning that Nuclear is actually much more expensive than is claimed. According to British Energy and British Nuclear Fuels, the cost of nuclear generation is between 2.2 and 3.0p/kWh. But the NEF says that this figure is probably a severe underestimate, with the real cost being somewhere between 3.4 and 8.3/kWh. This means that at a cost of 3.0-4.0p/kWh for offshore and 1.5-2.5/kWh for onshore production, wind is a far cheaper option than nuclear.\n",

            "[Doc 2002]: Though it is true the international Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutes and investigates crimes against humanity, the destruction and desecration of cultural property cannot be categorised as a crime against humanity. This is quite simply because human beings are not directly harmed when cultural property like ancient monuments or old scripts are destroyed. According to the ICC, the following would consist of crimes against humanity: ‘Murder, extermination; enslavement; deportation or forcible transfer of population; imprisonment; torture; rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; persecution against an identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious or gender grounds; enforced disappearance of persons; the crime of apartheid; other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental injury’ . The common factor with all these crimes is that they are committed as part of a ‘widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population’. This is simply because the ICC and the international community recognise that the most serious crimes that fall under the category of crimes against humanity are crimes of this nature that violently and systematically attack the wellbeing of civilians on a gross scale. The destruction or damage to any property, be it homes, government buildings, or sites of cultural heritage may well be a crime and a heinous act, but cannot come under the category of crimes against humanity.\n",

In 2019, Italy ’s and Spain ’s unemployment rates were around 9% and almost 14%, respectively. How would these countries be able to accommodate an influx of refugees during times of poor economic conditions? The newcomers require jobs to complete their integration, and it would be paradoxical for countries to commit to finding occupations for foreigners while their own citizens go jobless. As immigrants and unemployment affect each European country differently, not to mention France’s problem of immigrant-related terrorism , it seems unproductive for EU leaders to think a one-size-fits-all policy would work.\n",
            "[Doc 3669]: One of the principles in educating children is that they interact: communicating and informing others of their knowledge.

            "[Doc 4076]: When people are allowed to enter into pre-nups they can ensure themselves against things that they fear. For example, when the richer person enters into the marriage with the knowledge that his/her wealth is protected, the marriage will be better off because it will be clear that the other person is not marrying for money. As some legal frameworks necessitate sharing wealth 50/50, this could mean that assets will have to be sold, so that it’s worth can be divided equally. This will create a problem when some of those assets are inherited and have, therefore, sentimental value. This heightened sense of security will benefit both parties, as they can be much more confident with the marriage and not be suspicious of one another. \"Making a prenup may actually strengthen your relationship. While people often imagine that negotiating a prenup leads to conflict, communicating about money matters can actually improve the quality of your relationship and support good communication in your marriage.\"\n",
            "[Doc 65]: Even though the story of Alexander Hamilton took place centuries ago, certain themes strung through the performance are reminiscent of recent events in American society. These include the “repeated effects of speaking one’s mind ,” the clash of immigrants, and the elite and the promise of the “ American Dream .” In today’s era of “a society divided,” the musical, with its symbolism of resistance and inspiration for artists of color , particularly resonates today and may serve as a comfort or even a springboard towards action to change.\n",
            "[Doc 1255]: There is no good reason for children to be out unaccompanied late at night, so a curfew is not really a restriction upon their liberty. Where the child does have good reasons to be out they can be covered by the exceptions. They would be better off at home doing schoolwork, schools often set more than an hour a night which the children should be doing.

            "[Doc 2024]: Domestic legal systems will often suffer from a lack of judicial independence and potentially politicised prosecutions, and are also open to allegations of victors’ justice, or whitewashes by a judiciary biased towards the winners of the conflict. The ICC, as an effective court and with an independent judiciary, provides a suitable and unbiased climate for these cases to be heard in. While it is difficult to give any former head of state a fair trial, it is even more so in cases involving states divided along ethnic and political fault lines where any conviction could be seen as one based on continuing hatreds rather than evidence and criminal procedure. In addition, the principle of complementarity means African states can prosecute on their own if they wish.\n",

America’s mainstream media is presenting this document as the latest example of Trump’s hostility to Europe, and many European elites feel the same way. But the question is, *What kind of result do we look for?* And this is, I think, the most interesting question in this situation, because we have been trying to change the direction of the European Union for decades, since the 1990s. So, maybe Europe needs a shock from our good old friend America to start a true debate, because there was no debate in the European mainstream. And of course, you need power in at least one big European country to change the situation, France or Germany. It may not be so obvious from an American perspective, but Europe is very divided, and even the European conservative movement is very divided.\n",

            "[Doc 165]: There were search engines before Google . There were navigation apps before Waze. There were even social media sites before Facebook . In a study conducted of 500 companies, the first mover (first to sell a product) had a failure rate of 47% as opposed to the 8% failure rate the first follower faced. Why is this so? The previously mentioned companies weren’t necessarily better than their predecessors. They used the data that was already available to them from the first movers and improved themselves. They had better business models, better management and better timing. They were more focused and learned from the mistakes previously made by others in the field. Also, by entering the market later, they could see that there existed market demand for their product.\n",
            "[Doc 426]: People tend to conform to the ideas they learned as children, not only because of the feelings of security generated at home, but also because first impressions make stronger imprints on the brain than those that follow. Studies have found that a first impression, once formed, is hard to undo. This is especially true if a subject or person is first presented to you in a negative light. For example, one study that appeared in Social Cognition showed that people who observed someone who had made a bad first impression were slow to believe she had changed for the better, even after weeks of seeing her perform kind acts.\n",
            "[Doc 868]: When we think of dolls, the first brand to come to mind is most likely Barbie. Now think of mobile phones, did you think of Apple first? And what about soft drinks and fast food? Chances are high that Coca-Cola and McDonald’s first came to mind. Brand association is a big thing. There is a strong correlation between brand awareness and association and purchase decisions. By being the first brand to sell a product, if done right, you can make your brand name almost synonymous with the type of product (Kleenex or Band-Aid anyone?). The media is also more likely to cover a “first of” than a “slightly better” version.\n",
            "[Doc 988]: A huge advantage that innovators have when coming out with their product is being the sole seller of the product. The time period until their ideas are copied and products are reproduced is key in building a lasting relationship with their customers. By being the only option on the market, consumers have no other options and must turn to the innovator himself or herself when purchasing. Research shows that the most critical time to gain consumer loyalty is when they make their first purchase or begin service. As it costs about 6-7 times more to acquire new customers than it does to keep current ones, it’s better to “strike while the iron is hot” and make sure you get those first customers on board.\n",
            "[Doc 599]: The unfortunate reality is that more than two-thirds of startups fail in the first five years, which means you need a backup plan if things don’t turn out the way you want. As employers tend to evaluate your candidacy for a job based on the most recent job you had , you don’t want to find yourself stuck at twenty-five with a failed business and no job prospects. Your resume needs nurturing if you’re to have a safety net when all else fails.\n",
            "[Doc 2392]: When wages are extremely low the incentive to enter alternative markets is increased. This is particularly harmful in the case of illegal markets, such as those for drugs or prostitution. The minimum wage is essential for keeping the opportunity cost of entering the black market sufficiently high that people opt always to enter the mainstream, legal market. Furthermore, when the possibility of work in the legitimate market exists, even if work is harder to find due to a minimum wage, the very possibility of getting such a job will serve as a disincentive to pursuing illegal employment.\n",
            "[Doc 1937]: The free market views the human body and the human mind as a mere instrument: the only value an individual being has is the value it can sell its labour (whether it be manual or mental work) for on the market. Workers don’t work because they want to produce something they themselves find inherently valuable; they work to earn a living. And given that most people are not entrepreneurs or business owners, this means that most people will spend the most of their waking day labouring for goals set to them by others, in partial processes subdivided and defined for them by others, all to create products and services which are only valuable to others, not to themselves ( Alienation,  1977). This commodification of the human body and mind can go so far that humans actually start selling themselves: free market proponents propose to legalize the selling of one’s own organs. When humans start selling themselves, they perceive no value in themselves anymore – all they see in themselves is an instrument to satisfy other people’s desires, a product to be packaged and sold. This becomes even more pronounced when we take into account that the free market exacerbates inequality: if someone is born into a poor family and can’t get out of it, it might seem the only way to get out of it, is to sell oneself. Thus, the proposal to legalize the selling of one’s own organs amounts to an ‘unconscionable choice’: a choice which is, given the circumstances, unreasonable to ask of someone.\n",
            "[Doc 1509]: The truth can only emerge from competition between various ideas in free, transparent discourse. To silence any idea is to remove ideas from the marketplace thus reducing the individual’s ability to use his/her reason and intellect to arrive at a conclusion. When this happens, it becomes more likely that individuals who feel alienated from main stream society will find meaning in the hateful ideas which have also been excluded from the mainstream. This is very similar to the concept of the free market in economics where the freer the market the better off everyone is.\n",
            "[Doc 4104]: The Internet is founded upon principles of the free market - people are allowed to publish content and the content's success is based upon whether or not people like it.

            "[Doc 52]: Fewer than six percent of startups in the US are backed by venture capitalists or angel investors, so as much as you may be optimistic that you’ll be part of that statistic, the odds aren’t in your favor. An estimated 46 million Americans have student loan debts. As 65% of college students graduate with debt, starting your business right out of college will dig an even deeper hole into your already-empty wallet. Working a full-time job, on the other hand, will allow you to find your financial footing, so that you’ll have savings to fall back on after venturing off on your own. And, when it comes to looking for investments, teamwork experience is a MAJOR factor in the likelihood of raising funds – experience you need to first gain.\n",
            "[Doc 254]: Adding another player to the market creates competition between firms. This is positive, as competition is good for business and consumers. Buyers will get better prices for products (not to mention better quality of products) while companies will be able to learn from each other to perfect their respective product(s) and focus on what they do best. True, by being a fast follower, you will have to always bring your “A game”; this is the only way to succeed. However, this will also result in higher customer satisfaction, which may lead to larger revenues down the line.\n",

First, they led the league in points (485 points scored) while their defense allowed only 224 points (the second fewest in the league). Second, as previously stated, they lost only two games (one of them after assuring first place) during the regular season by only a combined five points. Third, they held a 75-point playoff margin (102-27), one of the best in football history (a margin that wasn’t achieved when their win was in their hands). Above all stands one fact that highlights just how good this team was: Both offensively and defensively, the Redskins had +43 sack ratio, while their QB was sacked only seven times throughout the entire season!\n",
            "[Doc 1641]: In Western liberal democracies, we generally consider an individual’s private sphere to be worth protecting. We only give the state license to violate it when something is objectively largely harmful to that person or to society. When something is not very clearly harmful we let people make their own decisions because the state is not infallible in its judgements about what lifestyles are better than others. Therefore, simply saying that there is a risk that printers will be misused is not sufficient grounds for banning them altogether. If technology makes it easier for people to do what they want, this is a good thing; if people then want to do things that we consider harmful this is a problem in itself. The solution is not to ban an entire means of production in order to stop a minority from producing dangerous things, but to educate people about the risks so they can freely make better decisions. Making it harder for people to do bad things is useless, furthermore, since those that wish to purchase a gun or take drugs can already find ways of doing so without 3D printers. One may even argue that it is better for everybody to have access to a gun, for example, and not only those who are willing to break the law to get one.\n",
            "[Doc 156]: Marriage is an institution meant to promote and safeguard relationships. However, if those relationships turn sour – whether due to infidelity, physical or emotional abuse, or incompatibility, divorce can be a positive channel that can help free affected partners from their suffering. It can consequently prevent the development of physical, emotional or mental health consequences. Divorce also enables incompatible partners to go their separate ways. Armed with the knowledge and experience acquired during their first marriages, divorcees have a better perspective of what they want and need in a new partner. If harnessed, this know-how can serve divorcees and help them find more compatible partners the second time around.\n",
            "[Doc 1967]: When it is politicians who control both the investment and the amount funds being returned from that investment then they have an incentive to encourage more investment. They will want more exploration to find more resources, they will promote technological advances to be able to extract more from the same fields, and they will be willing to grant more production licences. If on the other hand the money goes into a trust fund then the government and parliament has little incentive to encourage the market and every incentive to hold it up. The oil only provides a risk; unpopularity due to environmental impacts without any benefit in return. The result will be that the costs of drilling will be seen in the environmental damage it causes while communities do not get any of the benefit as the money is being squirreled away ‘for the future’. This is hindering the market and so reducing the economic benefits to the country.\n",

            "[Doc 3839]: In liberal democracies, the govt’s role is to enable the citizens’ rights. It ensures everyone can exercise basic rights & freedoms by taking care of education, health, security, etc. and operating the relevant services such as police, public health & school systems. Governments must ensure the basic services, but not give money. If the money enables any needed right, the gov should establish a service for it. Throwing money at the problem can’t ensure that the money will be used to solve it, or that it will be used well. When it comes to giving money, as opposed to services, this is what happens. Gov gives people money without enough supervision and follow up. And so, because it can’t address the minute details, the problems are perpetuated, not solved. If not, then what the gov is doing is simply taking money as taxes from everyone, and giving it away to others. The gov should only take money in order to provide needed services - otherwise it should leave it to every person’s decision how to spend their money. It is unfair to harm one person by taking what he worked for, in order to better another’s, who hasn’t worked to earn it, or might misuse it. If the money doesn’t serve a critical need, then one usage of it isn’t better than the other - in both cases, the money goes towards non-essential needs It’s the gov’s duty to enable the objective conditions needed to live in a humane manner through services which verify that the needed conditions are met. Subjective conditions are set by society, and so it is society duty’s to enable them. Money, which is free to use by the owner’s discretion, enables those subjective conditions, and so should be given to the poor by the society, since society has decided on the need and will be able to spread it better. Bottom line, as long as the citizens’ basic rights are enabled, then any additional financial expenditure should be done by society, who'll do it better.\n",
            "[Doc 1175]: The stock market works thanks to the liquidity Wall Street firms provide. It’s easy for people to buy and sell securities, because bank traders will facilitate the process. When the market is hot, companies can use their stock to raise capital. The money can then be allocated towards increased business investment, which leads to higher economic output . Additionally, Wall Street capital has been used to fund companies in vital industries like technology, which has created many jobs over the years. Without Wall Street, none of these market-based processes would work effectively.\n",

If a job is complicated, for example being a biological engineer, then the salary is appropriately high to encourage people to pursue that career.

Feb 26, 2025 · Why first movers often fail while second movers win big. Discover the hidden truths behind startup success and the key traits of great CEOs. Why is a first to market a good idea? The reason this theory works in some cases is that the first to market can capture a disproportionate amount of the customer base early on , influencing user behavior and becoming synonymous with the product itself. Uber didn’t just launch a ridesharing service; it became the name that defined the entire industry. Why should a company be first? The answer depends on a number of factors: the nature of the product, the competitive landscape, the company's resources, and the overall market readiness. In some cases, being first can give a company a crucial lead, allowing it to establish itself as the dominant player before competitors can catch up. When did the first mover & late follower enter the market? In the first study, the first mover entered the market in 2015 , while the second emerged a year later. In the second study, the late follower entered the market in 2019, after the first mover had gone through growing pains associated with care quality and data security. Is rushing to market a good idea? The key lesson here is that rushing to market may win the initial headlines, but it ’s the long-term quality of the product that dictates lasting success.

Lyft’s slower, more deliberate approach won it favor among certain customer segments, and while it may not have overtaken Uber in market share, it established itself as a credible and quality-driven alternative. What Lyft demonstrated is that while Uber captured market share, being first didn’t insulate Uber from problems caused by that breakneck speed. This philosophy has helped make Apple the most valuable company in the world, consistently delivering high-quality, refined products that resonate deeply with consumers. The key lesson here is that rushing to market may win the initial headlines, but it’s the long-term quality of the product that dictates lasting success.

            "[Doc 516]: During searches, Amazon users get the added bonus of being presented with similar products or products frequently purchased together. This makes Amazon’s comparison-shopping of brand vs. brand or product vs. related product fast and effortless. Another benefit of shopping on Amazon is the immediacy in which purchases are received. With services like Amazon Prime, the customer journey of “search – select – pay – possess” is near-instantaneous. Since Amazon delivers nearly two-thirds of its own orders directly to consumers, it’s no wonder that the company is giving UPS and FedEx a run for their money, competition that will only benefit consumers. It’s much faster than most other e-commerce stores. This benefit was appreciated during the pandemic lockdowns, as with efforts to combat price gouging. Being the market leader means that the standard Amazon adopts becomes the market standard, which, in turn, benefits all consumers. This can also be seen with Amazon’s PillPack acquisition , which highlights how its embrace of disruptive competition is a good thing for consumers.\n",
            "[Doc 844]: Shopping on Amazon requires users to input their personal information, which may put shoppers at risk of identity theft. While online privacy concerns are not an Amazon-specific issue, the company’s privacy policy may raise concerns about safeguarding shoppers’ personal information , security and privacy (as might varying Amazon smart products ). In fact, the company stood trial in Del Vechio v. Amazon.com as part of a class-action lawsuit for deliberately going against its customers’ privacy preferences and sharing its customers’ personal information with third parties without their consent – and against their wishes. Not to mention, in the past, there has been at least one instance where Amazon’s customer support team was accused of being tricked into handing over sensitive information, thus falling prey to the growing menace of social engineering hacking .\n",
            "[Doc 1206]: With Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods and its subsequent launch of Amazon Fresh in the spring of 2021, the company has become a monopoly of successfully merchandizing convenience, especially during the pandemic. Between Amazon Prime, as well as introducing cashierless supermarkets , the company will continue accounting for a large chunk of consumers’ spending. But shoppers may ultimately lose out; monopolies kill competition (e.g., Amazon was put under the spotlight for using data from its own sellers to launch competing products) and, once king, they can willingly change customer perks that made them so popular in the first place. Plus, the growing success of Amazon and its slew of digital endeavors may cause people and shop owners to lose their jobs as online purchases continue to climb. As Amazon expands to target other goods sectors, including providing delivery services for restaurant-prepared meals and Prime Air , its drone delivery service, which may put delivery people out of work.\n",
            "[Doc 114]: What truly sets Amazon apart is its brand promise : “customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence and long-term thinking.” Take its Prime video services, with original and award-winning TV shows and movies , or its cloud computing service, which is so successful that it, along with other companies, signed a multi-million contract with the CIA . If the promise of the internet is to provide users with what we need, when we need it – whether product- or service-related – then Amazon has proven that those who have the data can deliver on this promise.

            "[Doc 444]: Amazon allows small retailers to sell on its platform, thus providing them incomparable online exposure. In fact, almost half of internet users in the US live in a household with an Amazon Prime membership, and the site gets more than 2 billion visitors every month. How’s that for reach? In addition to new consumers, small business can’t ignore the benefits and tools that Amazon can bring them, like sales, marketing and branding pushes. It’s no wonder, then, that nearly 2 million small businesses in the US have started selling on the platform.\n",
            "[Doc 320]: Amazon.com is riddled with ads – specifically pop-up ads – that each prompt the user to buy another product, based on the user’s unique purchase history. Not only do many people find these ads annoying , but they tend to drive users to make unwanted and perhaps unbudgeted impulse buys. And while 84% of all shoppers have made impulse buys at one point or another, it may be easier to do so on Amazon since it invests heavily in exposing shoppers to new products at every step of their Amazon experience – from first opening the homepage all the way through checkout. The economic consequences on consumers living beyond their means can be devastating; various studies , for instance, show that materialism correlates to unhappiness in relationships.\n",
            "[Doc 15]: Shopping is called retail therapy for a reason. Studies have shown that the gratifying effects of shopping cause your brain to release more of the feel-good chemical serotonin . But this does not mean that acquiring or possessing all items “spark joy.” Sometimes you simply need items for practical reasons. You absolutely need a drawer full of underwear or outgrown baby clothes , or you may have to hold onto bags of pipe cleaners and markers for your kids. Are you happier because you own these items? No, but you can’t do away with them either.\n",

If shopping offline you most likely need to drive to the area you are shopping and then walk through the store hoping that they have what you need. Since you can simply type into a search bar online to find what you need, you can often find it right away and even with good deals.\n",
            "[Doc 924]: Online commerce virtually (and literally) guarantees shoppers more bang for their buck. The internet endows users the privilege to swiftly compare prices. With in-store shopping experiences becoming increasingly irrelevant, especially during the pandemic , competitive prices become online businesses’ key playing card. Large online retailers like Amazon know this and respond by offering the lowest market prices on their most popular and most viewed items. During recent holiday shopping seasons, sales were offered earlier in the year and for an extended period of time, which has seemingly become the norm . The internet’s price wars have an influence beyond cyberspace – many brick-and-mortar stores have adopted online price-matching policies in order to stay competitive with their online counterparts. Not to mention that swift “on-demand” order and delivery has changed consumer expectations (supply-chain problems aside), making convenience and comfort an ideal they can take for granted.\n",

            "[Doc 1936]: A ‘common good’ is a resource which has finite but replenishable supply but which is by its nature ‘non-excludable’ (meaning it’s hard to exclude individuals from using the resource). One example is the stock of fish in the sea. If all fishermen would refrain from overfishing, the fish population would have time to restore itself. But each individual fisherman has an incentive to capture and sell as much as possible. Since in a free market, there is no government coordinating supply and demand, each fisherman acts on their individual incentives. The result is rapid, irreversible depletion of the common good ( Tragedy of the commons,  1968). A ‘public good’ is a resource which is also ‘non-excludable’ but is also ‘non-rivalrous’, that is a good whose consumption by one consumer still allows simultaneous consumption by other consumers. One example of this is the air we breathe: every breath I take does not prevent you from taking a breath, nor can I feasibly exclude you from breathing. Other examples of public goods are schools, roads and national defense. Public goods suffer from the ‘free rider’ problem: once the good is produced, no one has an incentive to pay for the good. Since the good is non-excludable, no one can prevent someone from using it. This also leads to what economists call ‘negative externalities’: industries can freely pollute the air we breathe and not bear the costs for it. The issues of climate change are a direct example of this: corporations aren’t forced to pay for the negative externality of emitting greenhouse gases, and so continue doing it.\n",

            "[174/185] Summarizing: THE PERSPECTIVE ON DIGITAL MARKETING\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 251]: Traditional marketing was thought of as an operation that only takes effect once the product was ready to launch. In contrast, digital marketing (or more specifically product marketing) is thought of as part of an ongoing process in which feedback is collected and product improvements are made continuously. Through marketing data (i.e., how many people have reacted to a specific message or product), customers get to influence the products they consume. This integration of marketing into the company’s core business is key to the rise of many online giants. For companies like Booking.com, the optimization of marketing reach is what determines their revenue. The publishing industry’s revenue is comprised of the gap between the cost of acquiring a user and the money that can be made during their stay on a website (ads, subscription, etc.). There is a whole subset of businesses that drive traffic to other sites for a portion of revenue. Their whole operation is nothing but online marketing. Digital marketing also opened up new opportunities for small and medium business, where traditional marketing offered very few options for a local business. Digital marketing enhances the voice and precision of any interested individual for any budget and with minimal know-how.\n",
            "[Doc 666]: We assume that digital marketing took over traditional marketing because it provided a better result for those paying for it. However, there may be other factors that account for its success. Here are a couple such factors to consider: The business world at large, and the hi-tech sector specifically, are characterized by leaders who come from one of two backgrounds: business or technology. For these analytical minds, excel makes more sense than a creative hunch. A spreadsheet displaying CTR (click through rates) percentage over time is something they easily ‘get’; hence, they welcome performance marketing. In other words, digital marketing is their default choice – not because it’s necessarily better than traditional marketing but because it’s more familiar. This is also true for marketing agencies. With digital marketing, you have the playbook pretty much written before the client enters. The crucial know-how (CPC, CPA, CTR, etc.) relates to the media, not to the specific product. This is very different from traditional advertising, where you have to tailor a new suit for each creative challenge. Also, with digital marketing, it’s much easier to guarantee a 2-5 percent improvement year over year, which keeps the client happy.\n",
            "[Doc 407]: For a long while, marketing was seen as an important but not crucial function. It was the realm of the ‘creative folks’ and not of the people who actually built the business. Digital marketing matured the entire advertising industry and made marketing accountable. Unlike with traditional marketing’s elusive ROI, with digital marketing, it suddenly became clear where money was going and how much of it was earned in return – the same as any other business function. Marketing was invited to the big boys table and, as a result, became more influential, more professional, enjoyed increasing budgets and bigger staff.\n",
            "[Doc 421]: Any advancement that you can measure, be it revenues, productivity or number of employees, is what drives business forward. Digital marketing provides a clear understanding of what works and what needs fixing . It’s astounding to think that for generations, marketing was so expensive (up front) and offered so little in the way of clear return on investment. The tools and technology that are now part of digital marketing allow us to reach the relevant people with the relevant message, while eliminating redundant costs. (How many of viewers of a dogfood ad on TV actually have a dog?)\n",
            "[Doc 495]: Sure, a decade ago, any marketer knowing how to work the new platforms of Facebook and Google had a major advantage over the established ad man, but these days are long gone. The analytical approach has created a reality where most marketers perform the same actions, on relatively few platforms. In his book Alchemy , Ogilvy vice chairman Rory Sutherland asserts that if your entire marketing strategy is based on the logical and fairly established digital marketing venues, then your best-case scenario is reaching a crowded point, standing side to side with your competitors who have also followed the same logical and established routes. What’s the point of marketing if it doesn’t single you out?\n",
            "[Doc 2879]: Children are susceptible to marketing that promotes something as fun, exciting and glamorous. Because joining the Armed Forces represents a dangerous commitment to one's country, and they don't present it as such when marketing in schools, they should be banned.\n",
            "[Doc 1584]: Monitoring would be extremely tedious and time-consuming. Many teens send over 100 texts a day, it would clearly be very time consuming to read them all along with all other digital communication. Parents who meanwhile deem their children immature when it comes to social networking and gaming can instead impose user restrictions on the relevant websites and devices. In this case, only when children acquire sufficient digital maturity and responsibility can these controls be lifted. As they have learnt to be mature in the digital environment the children would most likely continue to surf safely even when the parental controls are lifted.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 1598]: When the experience of the internet differs between people because of their backgrounds and past activities, the position of the online experience as one free of informational prejudice is undermined. It is important that the internet and the sites and services that float around it be as free from external prejudicing that contemporary targeted marketing creates. This marketing shapes at the most basic level the internet experience people interact with, and as it differs between people the quality of the universal service is diminished in a way. The internet should remain a neutral space.\n",
            "[Doc 1545]: Think tanks are considered more credible than corporate marketing. In the case of think tanks, the recipient believes he is being given unbiased information. Therefore, it is tempting for corporations to finance think tanks and encourage them to reach the conclusions that they otherwise would promote through marketing. This way, think tanks can be powerful tools for promoting a biased agenda: if done successfully the same message is communicated but in the form of credible information rather than manipulative marketing. In fact, it is common practice for journalists to quote think tanks without labelling their political bias. By forcing them to disclose, any corruption or bias will become obvious to all.\n",
            "[Doc 851]: Product development has adapted to the demands of the digital world, and piracy helps make that happen. The data collected from illegal downloading sites is used inform decisions about which television shows and music are worthwhile investments. Giving away various media for free is now considered a successful marketing strategy ; going off the philosophy that piracy builds demand, the proof is in the numbers: Movies that are most pirated tend to be the highest-grossing in the box office, and in general, the movie industry flourished once illegal file-sharing came into play.\n",

            "[Doc 1366]: With the development of Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) and more generally the internet people have come to no longer simply consume media in a linear fashion, they take a more fragmented approach. In news consumption people no longer want to simply have one newspaper with a vast array of topics inside. They want to pick and choose which stories and columns they consume, people now prefer to pull the content they want rather than have it pushed on them. In a digital world the news consumer can become their own editor and no longer need to rely entirely on old hierarchical structures.\n",
            "[Doc 3000]: Marketing, that's all it is. Like Madonna, it's all hype. The elemental problem with the purchase and continuation of the bottled water industry is the marketing of it; if bottled water were advertised simply as a means to hydration in the same way that juices, fruits themselves, tap water, etc. are seen by the general public, then it may soon be realised that the coincidental nature of the sounds of the words 'l'evian' and 'live young' are just that: a coincidence. Water that has trickled through mountains for hundreds of years will not be like 'manna from heaven' trickling from the edges of the holy grail, it's just H2O.\n",
            "[Doc 2579]: The brain interprets printed and digital text in different ways, and people generally read digital text 20-30% slower than print. According to Pulitzer Prize winning technology writer Nicholas Carr, peer-reviewed studies show that reading hyper-linked text may increase the brain's \"cognitive load,\" lowering the ability to process, store, and retain information, or \"translate the new material into conceptual knowledge.\" In addition, students who type lecture notes instead of write their notes by hand tended to write more, process less, and perform worse on recall tests.\n",

            "[Doc 561]: In the 19th and 20th centuries, the iconic vault doors were a financial center’s promise that their client’s cash (or gold) would be safe from theft. Today’s banks promise security through technology – banks protect clients by offering highly encrypted digital transactions, early fraud warnings, and as of late, biometrics . Victims of digital fraud are protected by their banks and by the FTC, which imposes limitations on customer liabilities. Recognition of the vital role banks play in securing individual livelihoods – as well as that of the broader economy – has led governments in North America and Europe to insure depositors, making keeping one’s money in the bank far less risky than stashing cash under the mattress.\n",
            "[Doc 3234]: Music CDs replaced records and MP3s are replacing music CDs. Terrestrial TV has been mostly replaced by digital TV. Books themselves descended from parchment, which descended from papyrus scrolls and before that, stone tablets. Digital publications are the next technological step and so if the pattern is uniform, they will also replace the last step almost entirely. The thing you are saying is wrong typing and printing is a compelete different thing we used to write with our hands until the computer came out Now people type more than they used to printing is a differnt method\n",
            "[Doc 1008]: Many schools today don’t have the equipment needed to make technology accessible for their students. This is where smartphones as learning aids come into the picture. These everyday hand-held devices have more processing power than all of NASA’s computers when they landed a man on the moon . So, instead of dealing with computers, the teacher can simply ask the class to scan a QR code or enter a www address that will take students directly to interactive content for the subject they are currently studying. New innovations like AI (hello, ChatGPT ) is being used by students, whether teachers like it or not. Some are even incorporating it into classrooms, so those students with smartphones will have easy access to the competitive advantage that AI gives. When in-school education was compromised by the pandemic, hybrid learning became prevalent; digital education has since remained just another way for students to learn about the world around them and for teachers to communicate with them – on various digital platforms, all accessible by smartphones.\n",
            "[Doc 3075]: Most opponents of the opt-in scheme seem to be arguing from the perspective of a relative to the loved-one. But imagine if you or someone you loved needed a transplant.

            "[175/185] Summarizing: The Perspective on Google: is it too powerful?\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 102]: While people have the choice of whether to use Google’s services, the fact is that it’s expected, and difficult to survive the corporate or social worlds without it. Corporations thrive on using Google Hangouts to communicate and Google Calendar to share schedules between employees. Gmail has 1.5 billion users , which means the company has access to that many emails. Google Maps – which automatically comes with any Android phone – gives Google your exact location, at all times. None of this addresses the access the company has to your search history , from which they compile a profile of you in order to target you with relevant advertisements. Is Google too powerful? Consider this: Its search engine market share is 90% . The US government seems to think that Google is an illegal monopoly and is consequently suing the tech giant to break it up and halt alleged antitrust abuses. While Facebook gets a lot of flak for data manipulation , you have to choose to be on one of their three platforms to have your data compromised; Google, on the other hand, is practically the whole web , with minimal competitors , so no place is safe – not even your health records ! A 2019 hospital data-sharing deal highlights these privacy issues.\n",
            "[Doc 1191]: Together with Facebook , Google controls nearly 70% of the market in digital advertising; with its DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers), the company commands the infrastructure on which the majority of advertisements are managed. There are more than 2.9 million companies that use one or more of Google’s marketing services. After Google Search, the second largest search engine is Google-owned YouTube . Because of this, it’s the company’s way or the highway. Hence, the US antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant. Additionally, a critic was fired from a Google-funded think tank after publicly supporting the European Commission’s decision to fine Google for abusing its market power. This lawsuit aside, the company was under several antitrust probes stemming from multiple countries, on the basis of it being a monopoly . In 2018, they also faced Congressional scrutiny for building what was perceived as censored search engine for the Chinese market. Sure, there are alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo or Yahoo, but none have nearly the same reach – or overall offerings – as Google provides. So, is Google too powerful? The answer seems clear.\n",
            "[Doc 931]: Google has been accused of using its wealth to influence all levels of policymakers. This accusation seems to carry weight; the company has funded 330 papers on public policy alone since 2005. Additionally, in trying to defend themselves against claims that Google tampered with a 2012 FTC investigation, the company admitted in 2015 to having influence in Washington across a number of political domains. It’s not only the government that’s swayed by Google’s authority; academic research teams haven’t necessarily been aware of who the patrons are that sponsor their grants. A 2017 report revealed that Google-funded studies suddenly increased when regulators threatened the company’s business model – evidence of the level of Google’s academic influence and power.\n",
            "[Doc 1188]: Besides its search engine, the company’s other platforms have also positively reshaped the ways in which we function – for no direct fee. YouTube has transformed the music, television and advertising industries, putting a new, democratic spin on the idea of celebrity. It recently introduced a console-free cloud-gaming platform . Google’s APIs for Android has allowed people to develop their own apps and utilize them to grow revenue. Gmail, Chrome, Google Maps and Google Photos have way over 2 billion users combined, with Google Drive closing in on 1 billion users itself. Just building and maintaining data centers to support such platforms costs upwards of $10 billion , but the company enables free use of every product. It has created scores and scores of free, useful tools that have altered the way humans exist day to day.\n",
            "[Doc 1036]: Google brings new meaning to globalization. Thanks to the last decade of the company’s innovation and low-cost mobile broadband , developing countries like India , among many others, have free access to information, to which much of the rest of the world is already privy. With Google Search operating in over 135 different languages and Google Translate operating in 108 languages , the company’s ability to provide accurate translations to so many international viewers means that every web page is territory to be charted equally by anyone around the globe. Also, because the company is privately owned , the speed at which it can impact developing nations is much faster than that of governments with complicated interests to protect. Plus, Google’s annual Economic Impact reports assert that its search and advertising tools helped drive $385 billion in US economic activity in 2019. It’s ads and searches directly led to clicks for 16 million American businesses alone that same year.\n",
            "[Doc 2784]: with all the new smartphones that have internet access, it is easy enough to simply google an answer. Even non smart phones can be used to text answers.\n",
            "[Doc 728]: With the ability to have anything and everything sent to your doorstep, mom-and-pop businesses are less able to rely upon their local communities for clientele and must digitize to survive. Unfortunately, the online environment is rather unhospitable to small businesses. Google and Facebook make it extremely hard if not impossible for small businesses to compete against big brands. Historically, Google has favored big business , downgrading less mobile-friendly sites . Not to mention that, in the past, it has been accused of favoring its own search ads and services over those of competitors. Small businesses without the resources or savvy to push their businesses to the top of Google’s search engine food chain are inevitably relegated to the bottom of the search list. They may consequently feel forced to conduct their business as third parties on online behemoths like Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress, where they incur fees and are further relegated to internet obscurity.\n",

            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 256]: Google has immense access to research on every subject in any field, allowing them to advance science in a way no other company can. In 2010-2011, the company acquired an average of more than one company per week ( Fitbit , anyone?). Its mere vastness and computational power can be directed towards studying things like machine learning and interactions between computers and humans – which is how they’re on the way to creating self-driving cars . Alphabet Inc . – Google’s parent company – is tackling everything from home automation to drone delivery. Additionally, the company uses its wealth of information for humanitarian work, such as fighting child exploitation and tracking flu trends across populations, most recently helping with contract-tracing efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus and providing $6.5 million in funding fact-checkers and non-profits working to fight the spread of misinformation about the virus. It’s undeniable that the company’s power and prestige have greatly benefited the future of mankind.\n",
            "[Doc 990]: Android is the future, holding court when it comes to voice interfaces and AI . Google Assistant (GA) far surpasses Siri as a virtual assistant, with more accurate responses to questions and tailor-made service; for example, GA can read text on images and convert it into meaningful calendar updates, notes, etc., while Siri is still trying to piece together the answers to basic questions. Not to mention that Google, basically the infrastructure of the web, has a much bigger fountain of data from which to draw when perfecting their services. There doesn’t seem to be much to consider when asking iOS or Android . Not to mention, Android is coming out with phones that cater to both individual consumers and various industries, which feature removable batteries and walkie-talkies . The company’s focus on varied users’ needs offer more variety and function.\n",
            "[Doc 2987]: Mathematical and logical thinking is essential to a strong mental development. This is the kind of thinking that mathematics classes should be teaching. Instead, children are taught for hours on end how to calculate - when we have the most powerful calculating machines ever conceived in the palms of our hands. Almost every GCSE maths question can be answered by WolframAlpha . We should be asking our children to answer questions that even the most powerful calculating machine in the world can't answer - creative, pure mathematics, that requires mental leaps and imagination.\n",
            "[Doc 4049]: There are too many prisons as it is. They are too comfortable and free easy living full of too many returning short term offenders. Make prison tougher,less comfortable and longer sentences to deter the majority from returning. So what if they are overcrowded ? they should not have put themselves there, it was their choice. We want deterents not more expensive and unnecesaryprisons.\n",
            "[Doc 2924]: Daughters need to know that women can be powerful and aspire to good careers, and that this doesn't mean they can't also have children. Their mother is the example they will see the most and will learn to copy from an early age.\n",
            "[Doc 1654]: The world is full of suffering and pain among innocent people. If God is good and all-powerful then why is this the case? Either God does not exist or he is not worth believing in since he does not care about human suffering.\n",
            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 2016]: Prosecuting offenders is the only way to get a just outcome when there have been horrific crimes committed. At a most principled level, those who commit a crime ought to be held accountable for their actions even if they are powerful or it damages the chances of peace because the powerful must be shown not to be above the law. Even where the law did not exist, or the leaders were in control of the law, international norms provide a standard for what actions merit prosecution, and judiciaries have been very good at convicting those who committed atrocities. Having those who committed crimes convicted by law courts helps prevent those affected by atrocities holding grudges and put the past behind them so aiding the healing process .\n",
            "[Doc 259]: Data capture in real time broadens the scope of medical research through analysis of multiple demographics and populations. Before COVID-19, Brazilian researchers analyzed scores of data supplied by Twitter, Wikipedia and Google Trends, and were able to successfully predict the outbreak of dengue fever in several cities. Other patterns were similarly detected in Google and Twitter search data, allowing a team of epidemiologists to determine where Zika would spread in Latin America, several weeks before public-health officials declared a formal outbreak of the virus. Additionally, Big Data has facilitated research into efficient treatment options for cancer and Ebola. But let’s not forget the environmental impact: Sensors (both in space and on the ground) recording information about everything from water quality to weather are providing enough data to help us understand climate change , with global warming trends at the forefront of analysis.\n",

            "[Doc 1551]: When internet anonymity is used for bullying, it can make the situation much worse. Firstly, perpetrators are much less likely to hold back or be cautious as they are less concerned with the possibility of being caught.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 2982]: The reason the gap is widening is because wants (as anyone who has ever studied economics will tell you) are limitless. If the rich keep working towards satisfying their wants and remaining rich, the poor will/do, given the limits problem,lose out. Most of the poor are not provided with the opportunity to be rich, as the rich keep hogging these opportunities in an attempt to maintain their economic status quo...\n",
            "[Doc 3796]: Implementing a high tax for mining and extraction in resource rich nations will lead to a spread of such taxes being implemented throughout the world and will create a standard of high tax on resources on a global scale. However doing this will not, in the global reality we live in, “redistribute a portion of the wealth gained in mining and resource extraction” in a fair, sustainable and reliable way that directly adds value to the lives of a nation’s people . Also, the Prop propose that introducing such high taxes will reduce the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor. However, in reality, such tax would only further push the poor into poverty and increase the wealth of the rich as the mismanagement of funds cannot be guaranteed by many nontransparent nations in the world . This is counterproductive to the purpose that the proposition wish to achieve through the implementation of this tax. One of the major issues that we as the opposition have been continuously reinforcing is the trust involved in implementing such tax. It is clear that many resource rich nations have a lack of transparency in their governments’ desicions . By giving them access to such tax funds we cannot be sure that they will use it to directly help their people. Instead it is more likely that they will be using this tax to further line their pockets as corrupt nations make up well over half of the world’s countries We cannot give such a huge responsibility to societies where corruption occurs every day, rather we need to place pressure on companies to act responsibly.\n",
            "[Doc 3797]: Throughout this debate we have presented the Prop with several arguments explaining why the governments of resource rich nations should not impose a high mining and extraction tax. While we have considered the social, economic as well as environmental sides of the debate, the Prop have only considered the environmental impacts. They have even said, “ is the main point of this debate.” While we have continuously urged them to consider the welfare of citizens as well as the economy of a nation they have simply refused to negotiate on the real-life effects that high taxes would have on multiple stakeholders on both a domestic and global scale. The unfortunate truth is that we live in a volatile global reality, where corruption and mismanagement of government budgets are both a reality for over half the world’s nations . We have provided evidence on the corrupted nature of many resource rich governments and this proves this is a problem that must be considered when looking at the effectiveness of implementing these high taxes. We have also continuously pointed out that one of the main issues associated with implementing a high tax in resource rich nations is the trust that can be held in their governments. We have raised this question a number of times and all we have heard in response is that “if governments... are not interested in the welfare of their people, this is a problem beyond the scope of our motion”. We feel this is in fact a major problem that must be dealt with prior to establishing a new global norm of high taxation on mining and extraction industries as the negative implications and costs to the majority of resource rich countries will be too great. The realistic social and political impacts that the implementation of such tax will have on ALL stakeholders involved has been considered by us but ignored by the prop. The Prop have also graciously agreed that by implementing a high tax “the companies will buy less in order to stay within their budget.” This only proves that the implementation of such high taxes will mean that companies will be forced to reduce spending on current technologies and practices rather than encourage investment in developing new, environmentally and economically sustainable ones. The Prop have made several unsubstantiated assertions throughout their argument and they have ignored the realistic negative effects that we have proven to exist. In particular the rise in the cost of commodities would devastate the people of those nations as well negatively effect both import and export profits. There are better ways to achieve what the Prop has proposed and this must be achieved through incentives and pressure on companies rather than simply increasing tax.\n",
            "[Doc 279]: Forcing a small slice of Americans to bear an inordinate burden of funding the government is not just immoral but also counterproductive ; it kills jobs, and sometimes even results in lower government revenue. Raising taxes on the rich creates a disincentive for work and job creation, slowing down both. If higher taxes discourage a business from opening or expanding, it is not just the rich who suffer but also the workers who are not hired. Further, this means that tax hikes often do not have the intended effect of raising revenue. If high taxes slow down economic growth, the government ends up taxing a smaller amount of money at a higher rate. Sometimes, this means a tax hike actually leads to lower total revenues, but even in less extreme cases, tax hikes yield diminishing returns .\n",
            "[Doc 3319]: People would not be willing to pay taxes for a state which they do not agree with or do not want to be a part of. Therefore the higher the taxes that the public are paying without revolt or force means that the citizens are happy with how the state is run. Especially with the European Union, if people were not happy they could easily move elsewhere. By people staying in a country with high taxes, the Government is showing that they are effective and they are keeping their people happy.\n",
            "[Doc 3527]: It is an inevitable feature of democracies that the rich have particular access to politicians and policy-makers. While the rich don't have a need for public education because they can pursue education for their children from other sources, they have no motivation to lobby politicians on behalf of the education system and a perverse incentive to remove education from political agendas in favour of their preferred issues and legislation. Only by forcing the rich into the same situation as the poor can we expect to gain meaningful ground in terms of education reform, especially in terms of increased funding relative to national and municipal budgets. We cannot expect education will be a national priority until the entire nation has a vested interest in the good order of the system.\n",
            "[Doc 1687]: In order to sustain development and growth nations need to build domestic resource mobilisation capacities - through collecting tax and savings. Domestic resource mobilisation enables the transition into a capitalist mode of production - poverty can be targeted and sufficient economies built. Social and economic facilities can be provided. To meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and enhance performance capacity African nation-states need to improve the amount of funding they raise through taxes . In order for development to be assisted, international donors and intervention needs to focus on encouraging innovative models of taxation such as taxing mobile phones. Such taxes don’t have the track record of failure other taxes have providing a new opportunity to redesign the taxation system. Initiatives such as the mobile phone tax provide a trial for such a new model helping to gain support for future changes.\n",
            "[Doc 3654]: Any tax levied on purchases is inherently fairer. In the current system much of the burden falls on the poor, for the rich can afford accountants to help them find ways to avoid paying tax. A tax on sales can be adjusted so that goods which appeal to the poor are taxed less than goods bought by the rich: for example, Bentleys would be taxed greater than Beetles.\n",
            "[Doc 945]: The preferential treatment of the rich in banking is almost a given, from interest rates to service fees. The more money a client has, the better his prospects for receiving lucrative interest rates on loans, investment opportunities, and returns on those opportunities, thus expanding gaps between the rich and poor. Speculation is another tool for transferring wealth from the rich to the poor, which drove the 2007 mortgage crisis. The actual value of the homes that were speculated upon was much lower than the speculation-driven market value. When the speculators at the top realized this, they cashed out, precipitating the housing crash and resulting in more than two million home foreclosures . While large investors had the chance to cash out, working families were forced to relinquish homes they could no longer afford. These activities were underwritten by every large bank in America, showing their bottom line is dollars, not people.\n",

The money would be better spent by paying local workers do the jobs , as they may have the necessary skill sets themselves. Not to mention, it would provide locals with job opportunities. When volunteers use the money they raise towards their own trips (and opportunities to look good on social media), the community often ends up losing out.\n",

            "[Doc 1934]: Whilst the rich spend proportionately less of their income than the poor, the rest of their income is often invested in other areas and financial vehicles, boosting the economy in both the short and long term. In the short term this money allows businesses to take more risks owing to a greater pool of money to offset the risk, alongside lower interest rates. In the long term, these risks often lead to innovations that help the economy overall. In increasing the tax burden on the rich, the spending and investment that wealthy individuals partake in is cut off, preventing these areas of the economy from growing. Recessions and recession prevention are often reliant upon public perception of an economy’s general health and the extent of its exposure to less stable economies. Due to this feedback mechanism, it is possible, therefore, that an unfounded belief that tax rises could obstruct economic growth might cause panic amongst the media and the populace. A recession might come about through the mere expectation that there will be a recession. In fact, given that the majority of the media is controlled by the rich, it is within their best interest to report that there will be a crisis if there is a tax increase so that they can claim the policy was at fault in the future.\n",

It is something we as human's are designed to eat, we are Apex predators , top of the food chain, we are built to hunt and consume other animals. The arguments that meat is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly do not mean that we should not eat meat, it simply means that we should not eat as much. We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was. I do not believe that this was an immoral way of living, it is not about wether we shoudl eat meat it is about how we currently eat meat.

It is fundamental that the justice system should treat all offenders equally; if two people commit the same crime in the same circumstances but one is richer than the other then they have caused the same amount of harm so should pay the same price for that harm. Having a richer person pay more implies that crimes by the rich are necessarily more harmful to society regardless of what the crime actually is. Further, this system will cause anomalies, where rich people fined for small offences (e.g. littering) will have much larger fines than poorer people fined for more serious offences (e.g. This will make people question the fairness of the fines, which will negatively impact their relationship with the justice system.\n",

A wealth tax would require taxpayers to pay at regular intervals on the appreciation of their assets, regardless of whether they have the cash or liquid assets to pay. Under her plan, high-wealth taxpayers would likely pay taxes on their capital gains each year as their assets appreciate in value. Even a very wealthy individual may not have the liquid assets to pay the tax on their changes in wealth.

Also, the Prop propose that introducing such high taxes will reduce the ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor. However, in reality, such tax would only further push the poor into poverty and increase the wealth of the rich as the mismanagement of funds cannot be guaranteed by many nontransparent nations in the world . This is counterproductive to the purpose that the proposition wish to achieve through the implementation of this tax.

It is clear that many resource rich nations have a lack of transparency in their governments’ desicions .

Apple’s promotional videos for its new headset—the Vision Pro, a metal-and-glass, ski-goggle-like apparatus that costs around thirty-five hundred dollars—show people experiencing V.R. for the first time. In the intervening decades, V.R. has thrived at two extremes in the quest for “killer apps.” It has long been an established industrial technology: if you’ve flown, ridden, or sailed in a factory-built vehicle in the last thirty years, virtual reality may have played a central role. Nonetheless, experiences will come from all kinds of companies, and V.R. could agitate and depress people even more than the little screens on smartphones.

            "[Doc 1194]: Jobs provide an inordinate amount of real-life learning opportunities, which you can later apply to your startup to help it thrive. Bill Clerico , CEO and founder of WePay, cited his experience at his first job as what gave him the skills to start his successful fintech company. And, as every startup has to answer a need, choosing an industry-specific job can help you recognize a pain point in your field that your startup could address. Take Bob Evans , founder of a nationwide restaurant chain and sausage plant, who initially started making his own sausages because he couldn’t find any of quality to serve the customers at his diner.\n",
            "[Doc 3922]: If the school hours are extended, adults wouldn't have to pay for after-school care for as long as they would now. Also, they would be able to work longer hours thus getting more money, and making life more of a luxury. For instance, lets say that you finish school at 3pm. Your parents might put you in after-school care from 3pm-5pm, until they can pick you up. After-school care, in my case, is $50 per hour. Are parents willing to pay this price? If we extend school hours to 5pm, they won't have to put you in after-school care saving about $500 per week. Also, adults could work for longer and pick you up at about quarter-past 5-5:30, as you are allowed to stay after school is over for an amount of time. If we make school longer, this will save money, get adults more and make your life more luxurious.\n",
            "[Doc 250]: What do Amazon, eBay and Coca-Cola have in common? These three companies had this motto in mind. They acted fast solely on the belief in their product. By being a first mover, you get a head start on your potential competition and are in a prime position to test the product with real users. This process, where testing and adapting are done in front of real users, as opposed to a development lab, is at the heart of the popular “lean startup” dogma.\n",
            "[Doc 52]: Fewer than six percent of startups in the US are backed by venture capitalists or angel investors, so as much as you may be optimistic that you’ll be part of that statistic, the odds aren’t in your favor. An estimated 46 million Americans have student loan debts. As 65% of college students graduate with debt, starting your business right out of college will dig an even deeper hole into your already-empty wallet. Working a full-time job, on the other hand, will allow you to find your financial footing, so that you’ll have savings to fall back on after venturing off on your own. And, when it comes to looking for investments, teamwork experience is a MAJOR factor in the likelihood of raising funds – experience you need to first gain.\n",
            "[Doc 2165]: All children should have equal opportunities, a breakfast for all helps provide this. With schools providing breakfast for everyone the start to the day will be the same for all. No one will starting school hungry or thirsty. Everyone will have had a chance to wake up before their lessons start allowing them to get as good a start to the day as possible.\n",
            "[Doc 2777]: I think that iPod's should not be allowed in school to some degree because it gets distracting at times, and people can be playing games and be on the internet instead of listening to the teacher and learning at school. There is a purpose to school, and if you decide to just sit there and play games all day then you will not learn anything, and your grades might start dropping. I think that people should be allowed to be using their iPod's and electronic devices when it is recess time because that is the time when you are free to do anything you want. if people want to spend their recess on there iPod's when it is their free time, I think that, that is totally fair. I think that any other time during school hours is not ok, because if a person is talking and you are sitting in your seat with your iPod, then you might get it taken away, but it is also being disrespectful to the person that is talking, because you are not giving them your attention and being a respectful listener. you can download games and apps prior to going to school and use them while connected to school wifi or not\n",
            "[Doc 1003]: Starting a company, whether or not it succeeds, may be one of the biggest learning opportunities that exists, if your goal is ultimately to have your own company. It’s do or die when you run your own business; you are forced be a jack of all trades, taking on sales, networking, marketing, data crunching, and a myriad of other skills that you would otherwise find difficult to come by at a desk job. For those who don’t yet know which career path interests you, launching your startup will give you the chance to try a bit of everything and see what you love. Sources say that your chance of starting a business that will succeed increases if you’ve started a business in the past, so the best way to get to successful venture number three is by launching venture number one!\n",
            "[Doc 3193]: A Sikh's belief means that they have to have the Kirpan with them at all times. If it is not permitted in school, they cannot go to school. Creating a condition where it is impossible for a child to go to school is the same as violating their fundamental right to an education. There should not be a situation in which you have to choose between the tenets of your faith and ultimately the foundations of your identity as a person or your right to education. You cannot compromise on your own identity – you can't only half be you. Neither can you have only half a faith in your religion.\n",
            "[Doc 979]: One need only look at the world’s current industry idols to see why jumping into the workforce right out of high school may be a good idea. Bill Gates , Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg – now household names – dropped out of college to gain work experience, which ultimately started their (extremely successful) careers. Work experience gives you a leg up on future employability and helps you to shape your own career goals. While you may not know exactly which field you’d like to pursue, the soft skills you’ll gain in any job will be crucial to moving you forward in life. Additionally, gaining financial security will help broaden your options in the future, whether you decide to invest, buy a house , start a business or go to school.\n",
            "[Doc 3575]: The driving age should not be raised to 18 because driving takes training and sitting on your butt for two more years is not going to put any more expirence in you. No matter what age you start driving, you will be inexperience. So you minds well start out at 16 where you are still in high school and are not going to college or start working. I'll gradutate high school at 17, so it would be nice to have a license before I graduate, so I dont have to worry about learning how to drive and take the test, when I am on my own. Plus, the only way to know how to drive in the winter, know the speed limit, where pot holes are, and how to handle sharp turns is to get out on the road and drive.\n",
            "[Doc 128]: You’ll probably succeed in preventing your preteens from drinking alcohol. However, once they turn 16 or so, it is likely that their high school friends may be drinking , which means alcohol could be easily available to them. So, what’s safer? Allowing your teenager(s) to safely taste alcohol under your supervision (like what happened during the pandemic, when 1 in 6 parents first allowed their adolescents to have an alcoholic drink at home during shutdowns) or take the chance that they’re consuming alcoholic drinks or riding in cars with teenage drivers without your knowledge? If your kids know that you don’t disapprove of them drinking in safe and legal environments, they won’t need to hide it from you. Plus, you’ll be able to warn your teens in a non-judgmental way about the dangers of drinking with strangers and at parties. Let’s face it, they’ll be more willing to take your advice to heart when it’s not a stern lecture or scolding after-the-fact.\n",
            "[Doc 760]: Small-change investment apps usually restrict you to specific stocks or Exchange-Traded Funds. For long-term investment goals, such restrictions could confine your options. Additionally, when your income stream eventually goes up, you may want to diversify your portfolio in ways that the apps won’t allow. Your money should be working for you; if there’s a time in your life when you suddenly have money to invest (like after your wedding, or when your company gave you a car and you sold yours…) then investing in small-change stocks isn’t for you.\n",
            "[Doc 2249]: For many parents, particularly those with more than one child, summer vacations can be a stressful and difficult time. Without the structure provided by school attendance, children become bored easily and parents struggle to cope. This is especially true for mothers who may be bringing up children without a father present, or those who wish to continue or resume their careers after the first few years of motherhood; trying to combine a full-time job with the rigours of motherhood is hard but trying to do so during a three month school holiday is almost impossible. Year-round schooling makes such a work-life balance easier for young parents and allows women to return to the workplace on their own terms.\n",
            "[Doc 2783]: i think cellphones are a bad idea to bring to school because there is a probability that you phone might get lost, and your going to tell your parents that you lost the phone. They would get really mad at you. The other bad thing about bringing your cellphone to school is that someone might steal it and not give it back to you. They also might call random people and talk to them. If your cell phone has an annoying ring tone it might ring in class and the teacher might take it and not give it back to you. There are so many things that can go wrong so i think that cellphones should not be allowed in school. If there is an emergency then you can use the office phone or use your friends.KA\n",
            "[Doc 860]: Divorce almost always hurts the finances of all parties involved. Marriage researchers have found that women’s household income will typically fall by 41% following a divorce or separation after age 50. In contrast, men’s household income only drops by 23%. Fathers typically must pay child support and, in some cases, alimony as well. Less than half of custodial parents who were supposed to receive full child support payments receive what they are owed. This leads many divorced parents to fall into poverty, as they must also cut back on work hours to provide after school care for their children. When there is only a single parent left with the children at a given time, it can be difficult for that parent to hold a full-time job and earn a decent living.\n",
            "[Doc 3395]: REPLY: You are totally wrong about that. We at least progress the best when we do what we do in life voluntarily. School is abysmal and if it should exist at all it should be optional. That would make people a lot happier. It's an abomination to dogmatically make young people go to school for no reason let alone hit them! Only disgusting adults who have personal problems would hit children and coerce them into doing things they don't want to do. So-called \"education\" is a hollow word used as a smokescreen to con people. School is enforced because of scum that desire to oppress their fellow human being and because they know there's no real reason to go to school so the only way to make people go is by coercing them. Using coercion on people is a abominable. Especially on vulnerable and defenseless young people. School is not responsible for your 4th point so you can't say that. And I definitely don't think that school has bettered us. Something so totally oppressive and demeaning cannot be helpful. I am utterly NOT grateful for school and you can be dead sure of that. It only served to leave me with emotional wounds. Looking back on it I can say that if I'd had the choice I would have certainly said no to it. And we learn the most when away from school. There are people who think the same as me on this matter. We need to respect people's right to say no to school. School is a big spurious lie and being introduced to it at age 5 is a horrifying experience. I'm wondering just how many hints people need to realise that school's a bad thing.\n",
            "[Doc 2773]: It should be allowed to use cell phones in schools as if there is any emergency case parents can easily inform their children. It should not be allowed to use during lectures but during break it should be allowed. And it also helps after school time as if the children have any transport problem they can inform their parents. Other than this if they have to stay at school after the school time is over for any type of preparation they can inform their parents. but there is some schools that let phones in because of the safety reasons.\n",
            "[Doc 2664]: They are also more likely to have to work after school and on weekends, or look after younger siblings, leaving less time for homework. A study by the Hispanic Heritage Foundation found that 96.5% of students across the country said they needed to use the internet for class assignments outside of school, and nearly half reported there had been times they were unable to complete their homework due to lack of access to the internet or a computer, sometimes resulting in lower grades. Private tutoring is a more than $6 billion enterprise that further advantages students from wealthier families. A study published in the International Journal of Education and Social Science concluded that homework increases social inequality because it \"potentially serves as a mechanism to further advantage those students who already experience some privilege in the school system while further disadvantaging those who may already be in a marginalized position.\"\n",
            "[Doc 3932]: When the internet comes under surveillance, you will not be able to express your ideas freely. There is sophisticated software that can be used to extrapolate your activities on the internet. With this data, you can be targeted by the state or a private agency. When you become aware that this is happening, you will be less likely to express your views online. You will also fear to research certain topics. The result is that you will lose perspective, which will affect your ability to make the right choices. This self-censoring can have negative consequences on society in the long term. Besides your freedom of thought, your freedom of movement is also threatened. This happens when your online data is used to track your physical location. This is a major impediment to freedom of association. In some cases, it will affect your ability to protest injustice for fear of being tracked.\n",
            "[Doc 426]: People tend to conform to the ideas they learned as children, not only because of the feelings of security generated at home, but also because first impressions make stronger imprints on the brain than those that follow. Studies have found that a first impression, once formed, is hard to undo. This is especially true if a subject or person is first presented to you in a negative light. For example, one study that appeared in Social Cognition showed that people who observed someone who had made a bad first impression were slow to believe she had changed for the better, even after weeks of seeing her perform kind acts.\n",

            "[179/185] Summarizing: The Perspective on Big Data\n",
            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1135]: Big Data is too large for the average person to analyze on his or her own. Therefore, most people and many companies lack the data analysis required for informed decision-making that may provide competitive advantage. Such analysis requires advanced technological tools that many people simply don’t have. Therefore, it’s not a level playing field , as the large, wealthy institutions may be able to benefit more from big data compared to small businesses or individual people. Aside from the unfair economic disadvantage, Big Data fosters divisive lines between social classes. At least 7% of Americans aren’t online, and people from lower income levels don’t leave nearly as big a digital footprint as their wealthier counterparts. This means that when researchers or journalists rely on web-generated content (like social media or Google searches) for Big Data analyses, those without an online presence tend to have their own issues ignored. In other words, Big Data only benefits the people who are rich enough to control it.\n",
            "[Doc 190]: At least 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone – exciting, right? Yet, our ability to draw conclusions from said data (referred to as actionable insights) haven’t developed at the same accelerated speed. Therefore, an excessive amount of data can be just as confusing as having none at all. Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase said it best: “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.” Let’s also look at ad targeting, the most common use of data technology. While there are constant developments, our daily experiences may include instances that show that Big Data can still be limited. Like when your daughter may get a shaving cream ad because she happens to watch her cartoons on your YouTube account. Without the proper analytics, Big Data is less effective.\n",
            "[Doc 277]: From the media to the government, the misuse of Big Data has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society. You’ll hear it everywhere: Privacy is all but dead . It’s all but impossible to prevent today’s big tech companies from tracking our data and misusing it, as the 2020 tech antitrust Congressional hearing with Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple before showed. As Jeff Bezos’ s hearing revealed, besides misusing data to create unlevel playing fields, Big Data also makes it easy for evidence to be distorted, allowing any company to push their own agenda, regardless of reputability. Additionally, in 2016, Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal opened the eyes of many to how easily they could be targeted and their information compromised without their knowledge . In 2018, it was uncovered that China was using Big Data in its new social credit system to store people’s information and use it to monitor and ultimately control their behavior. Over 6 million Chinese citizens were blacklisted from flying as a consequence of social misdeeds. Thanks to Big Data, it’s impossible to stop vast amounts of personal and professional information from being exploited.\n",
            "[Doc 1210]: Big Data is making smart societies a reality. Institutions like MIT are using Big Data analyses to build “ smart cities ” that will ultimately help reduce living costs, energy consumption and harmful environmental emissions, and generally improve quality of life . In 2013, Los Angeles replaced thousands of traffic lights with LEDs, which created a data system informing the city of every light’s status and traffic flow at all times. This system ultimately resulted in brighter streets, a smoother flow of traffic and, consequently, fewer traffic accidents. Saudi Arabia is using Big Data for adequate crowd control to prevent stampedes among the millions of Muslim worshippers who embark on an annual pilgrimage to Mecca. This is done by utilizing real-time insights to predict crowd movements and avoid congestion. Big Data is paving the way for more efficient lifestyles; the more we collect, the smarter we become.\n",
            "[Doc 259]: Data capture in real time broadens the scope of medical research through analysis of multiple demographics and populations. Before COVID-19, Brazilian researchers analyzed scores of data supplied by Twitter, Wikipedia and Google Trends, and were able to successfully predict the outbreak of dengue fever in several cities. Other patterns were similarly detected in Google and Twitter search data, allowing a team of epidemiologists to determine where Zika would spread in Latin America, several weeks before public-health officials declared a formal outbreak of the virus. Additionally, Big Data has facilitated research into efficient treatment options for cancer and Ebola. But let’s not forget the environmental impact: Sensors (both in space and on the ground) recording information about everything from water quality to weather are providing enough data to help us understand climate change , with global warming trends at the forefront of analysis.\n",
            "[Doc 1165]: Industry benefits greatly from Big Data, which gives companies insight into their customer base. This was especially true for the healthcare industry today; big data provided and still provides vital insights into disease prevention efforts . Data allows companies to better understand their clientele and improve upon their services as a result. Internally, corporate insight and employee productivity and satisfaction can also be improved by analyzing workplace interactions and using the results to optimize work environments. For instance, Bank of America used sensors to track social dynamics in the office, and found that their best workers were ones who took breaks together. This resulted in group break policies, which saw a 23% rise in employee performance .\n",
            "[Doc 1612]: The data collected and sold by companies is not safe. Servers with even the most sophisticated security systems are susceptible to hackers and other miscreants seeking to exploit the personal data of unsuspecting customers. Identity theft is a ubiquitous threat in the Information Age, one that increases every year as the arms race between data protection designers and invaders rages on. Data breaches have been rapidly increasing  and although the total number declined from 412 million exposed records in 2011 to 267 million in 2012 this has increasingly been due to hacking rather than simple negligence. As individuals see companies as being uncaring of their information they tend to punish them in the market. Firms are better off not playing with fire and keeping data that could have huge potential costs to them if it is lost, and individuals are better off not having their information disseminated across cyberspace without any guarantee of its safety. Technical report, Federal Trade Commission”.\n",
            "[Doc 295]: This show has a story that’s big on emotions . Though it has its share of funny moments too, Moulin Rouge is, at heart, a tragic play. From the first moment to the inevitable end, the story contains big aspects: there’s big drama, big love, and big jealousy. The love at the center of the story is a sacred entity, the show’s villain is as evil as they come, and the friendship is as brave as they come – it’s opera-size in its vividness and is also unapologetic, which fits with the over-the-top world of the show. If you are into a roller coaster of emotions, get a ticket to this show!\n",
            "[Doc 1274]: If the ISPs were actually making their money on the basis of data provision rather than bandwidth then it’s in their interest to provide it. If they can’t, they don’t make money. If they want to sell more data, they have to provide more bandwidth, otherwise they can’t do it. This way both the data gluttons and the dieters get what they want. The gluttons get a fast provision of the resources they want or the capacity to share those resources at a reasonable speed and the dieters get cheaper provision. Measures being pursued by the European Commission aim to do exactly this. They will allow ISPs to control the passage of data across their networks but must, at the same time, make it clear what they are doing and offer low data use price plans accordingly . This is more so with mobile devices than with ‘plumbed in’ ones. For many people, it wouldn’t occur to them to use Skype for a call and a phone – even a smart one – is primarily just that, a phone. Why should they pay for a capacity they will never use because others can’t take a bus journey without watching a movie? European Commission to propose net neutrality measures.\n",
            "[Doc 1080]: It doesn’t matter if you’re erecting a billboard or sending a mass newsletter. There is always one person at the other end of a marketing message. This person is a human being, and, as such, s/he is led by evolution, circumstance, mood, culture and subconscious to an equal or greater degree than logic. The basic idea here is that you can’t use a rational tool to illicit action from an emotional and unpredictable being. (Ever tried to logically persuade someone from the opposite political agenda about your point of view? Did it work?) Our attachment to our views despite evidence to the contrary is well documented . This innate human “failure” also comes into play in the way we understand data. Big data means that there are enough facts to support more than one claim. We can more easily identify and demonstrate patterns we are partial to, or as the renowned economist Ronald H. Cause once said: “If you torture the data long enough, it will tell you anything.”\n",

            "[Doc 3932]: When the internet comes under surveillance, you will not be able to express your ideas freely. There is sophisticated software that can be used to extrapolate your activities on the internet. With this data, you can be targeted by the state or a private agency. When you become aware that this is happening, you will be less likely to express your views online. You will also fear to research certain topics. The result is that you will lose perspective, which will affect your ability to make the right choices. This self-censoring can have negative consequences on society in the long term. Besides your freedom of thought, your freedom of movement is also threatened. This happens when your online data is used to track your physical location. This is a major impediment to freedom of association. In some cases, it will affect your ability to protest injustice for fear of being tracked.\n",
            "[Doc 1611]: The gathering of personal data that companies undertake is done in a fashion that is fundamentally invasive of individuals’ privacy. When individuals go online they act as private parties, often enjoying anonymity in their personal activities. Companies, particular online services, collate information and seek to use it to market products and services that are specifically tailored to those individuals. In the context of the internet, this means that individuals’ activities online are in fact susceptible to someone else’s interference and oversight, stealing from them the privacy and security the internet has striven to provide since its inception. At the most basic level, the invasion of privacy that collating and using private data gleaned from customers is unacceptable. This can lead to serious abuses of individuals’ private information by corporations, or indeed other agents that might have less savoury uses for the information, most obviously the more places your personal information is the more likely it is to be lost in a data breach with 267million records exposed in 2012. Giving companies that are driven by profit motive to sell on their customers’ data to anyone that might offer a suitable price stands as an absolute theft of personal information and privacy.\n",
            "[Doc 122]: As with any internet-connected device, smart homes are at risk of getting hacked. Each connected device notifies its corresponding app when it’s being used, sending a digital fingerprint to the router. Hackers monitoring your router can learn about your daily schedule and view videos/images of you or maps of your home. Such data can be beneficial to anyone wanting to break in or spy on your once intimate home life. (And what about the nightmare of hackers taking over control of your home?) A less frightening but still worrisome element is that your internet-connected devices, which are supposed to be serving you, are actually serving the needs of manufactures and tech giants. The data these devices are gathering about your home and family will probably be shared with companies using data accumulation for financial gains. This invasion of privacy is permissible after Congress voted in 2017 to allow Internet Service Providers to collect and sell customers’ internet usage data .\n",
            "[Doc 1273]: This was the clinching argument in the Dutch example. Labour MP Martijn van Dam, one of the bill’s co-authors said that Dutch ISP KPN was similar to “a postal worker who delivers a letter, looks to see what’s in it and then claims he hasn’t read it. It is simply a basic principle of the Internet that for it to continue working as it does now, all data needs to be treated the same otherwise judgements will be formed on ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ data . The principle here is that the data being used is simply none of the ISPs business. Their job is simply to provide an agreed bandwidth, at an agreed price to the end user. How the end user makes use of that band width is up to them. If, for example, they’re choosing to Skype from a mobile device – one of the points of contention – it’s hard to see what that has to do with the ISP.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",

            "[Doc 3936]: Big businesses would like to keep track of you all the time. If they could, they would want to know when you get up, go to sleep, and eat.

            "[Doc 644]: We live in an age of science and technology. Frankly, from a scientific perspective, many of the “facts” of the Bible may be too outrageous to believe. Can a man really be swallowed by a whale and live to tell his tale? How can it be that snakes that had vocal cords once no longer have them? While the Bible claims the world was created less than 6,000 years ago, scientific research in the field of physics has proven that the Big Bang , which began the cycle of life that has evolved to this day, took place 13.7 billion years ago.\n",
            "[Doc 3685]: It seems unlikely that compulsory testing and labelling will help much. One of the big problems is that many people dont ask or are in denial.

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 1016]: Major airlines are better equipped with resources to help passengers when needs arise, in comparison to their low-cost counterparts. In the event of flight delays, cancellations or luggage misplacement, traditional airlines have policies in place to offer passengers travel rerouting, refunds and compensation packages. This is something that low-cost airlines are not always able to do, as was seen with the 2018 Ryanair airline strike , during which hundreds of flights were cancelled. Another example is the case of Icelandic low-cost airline Wow Airlines, which left thousands of passengers stranded at Kaflavik airport in March 2019 when it declared bankruptcy and suddenly ceased operations . While traditional airlines are not perfect , they try to stick to relatively strict flight schedules and allow passengers to view their plane seats ahead of time. Low-cost airlines, on the other hand, reserve the right to make last-minute flight timing and seating changes, without due warning.\n",
            "[Doc 1031]: Low-cost airlines take a no-frills approach, which is how they are able to keep their fees relatively lower than traditional airlines. They save on luxuries, like reclining seats, which reduces initial plane purchase and maintenance costs. This translates into less expensive tickets. Plus, flight attendants on low-cost airlines often cover many roles, including ticketing, in-flight services and cleaning. Having a smaller staff also means companies can reduce their ticket prices. While the in-flight experience may not be as comfortable (to a degree) as with traditional airlines, travel is a means to an end. Who wouldn’t prefer spending their hard-earned money on the reason(s) they are flying – be it hotel, shopping, or exotic destination – than on the flight itself? Plus, if taking one of the many red-eye flights that low-cost airlines offer, you’ll also have fewer crowds to deal with at the airport, which leaves more time for sightseeing.\n",
            "[Doc 131]: Today, the war in Ukraine is affecting oil prices worldwide and therefore airline ticket prices, too. However, low-cost airlines are still cheaper than traditional airlines. The biggest advantage to flying low-cost is the ticket price – which is often about 20% lower than that of larger airlines – but can be even lower when booking early. Intermediaries, like travel agents, are generally not used for booking, which cuts down on overall costs for the consumer. Low-cost flights also make off-peak benefits available, like lower ticket prices for traveling on red-eye flights when airport taxes are at their lowest.\n",
            "[Doc 906]: Flying anywhere – even for just a few days – is an ordeal. Arriving at the airport hours in advance, undergoing personal and baggage security checks, passing through passport control and then traveling from the airport to your actual destination is all time-consuming and exhausting. Therefore, having a good flight experience is key to having a successful vacation or business trip. Positive in-flight experiences are more likely with traditional airlines, since you typically pay one fee for full service. Sure, today, even many traditional airlines have introduced separate charges for assigned seats, checked luggage and in-flight catering and entertainment, there still may be hidden fees with low-cost airlines, like check-in fees, taxes, or insurance costs that often catch many travelers by surprise.\n",
            "[Doc 949]: Low-cost airlines tend to fly newer planes, which they can acquire at a large discount when placing bulk orders. For instance, Ryanair bought 151 new planes of the same model (Boeing 737) during the post-9/11 air travel slump; the large size of the order is what made each plane so cheap. Many of the air carriers that budget airlines use are newly built or recently retrofitted to meet current safety standards and requirements, and passengers are able to enjoy a smoother, safer flight. Some argue that the planes may also be more fuel-efficient . In fact, the fuel efficiency of younger planes offsets the more expensive purchase price of newer models. That’s how EasyJet has four-year-old planes and Spirit’s vessels average 5.7 years. This, unfortunately, is not the case of many traditional airlines, which continue to fly planes that can be 20 or more years old!\n",
            "[Doc 475]: Passengers flying legacy carriers are offered better flight times and choices of airports. Unlike low-cost airlines, traditional carriers provide nonstop flight services from their (multiple) larger hubs to many smaller destinations. What’s more, as larger airlines have greater budgets, they can afford to pay steeper airport taxes, enabling them to obtain more optimal takeoff and landing slots at more central airports.\n",
            "[Doc 3748]: The fact that it is a new year and it is a traditional time to make promises isn't a good enough reason to make a lifestyle change. You should decide to make the change because you want to improve yourself, you want to iron out your flaws, you want to stop doing something that damages yourself and your relationship with people you care about, you want to succeed at a particular goal in life. To just copy what other people are doing isn't sincere. If you wait until the time that's right for you, you will have more enthusiasm to start or you might find that you don't really want that goal for yourself. Comparing yourself with other people and competing isn't the point of improving yourself. Why is the way someone else is living their life anything to do with you?\n",
            "[Doc 3978]: Imagine you own a house that you have ruined over the years and never bothered to fix any of the integral parts of it, like the hole in the roof, the foundation, running water, garden, and it has become unsanitary, you need 1 Million dollars to fix it up. Instead you plan to abandon this house since you don't like the neighbourhood anyways, and you want to buy yourself a new one. You're really picky and won't settle for anything less then a perfect new home, no matter the cost. You hire a Realestate agent, his fee to search for your dream home is $1 Billion Dollars, and the potential new home you're looking in that perfect neighbourhood will cost you more then 100 Trillion dollars. You're conviced to go with the latter option, cause you're under the immpression that some really interesting girls live there, but you're agent has yet to confirm anything of this information. His search still continues.... We know that us humans exist but we don't know if \"space creaters\" exist so why bother. If there are things out there they don't hurt us. We people in your country we are like family and you have to help family.\n",
            "[Doc 1032]: Traditional employment was at one time the cornerstone of a secure future for most Americans: Companies and organizations provided health insurance programs and retirement plans which were, for the most part, financed by the employer. When workers step away from traditional employment, their “buying power” with respect to health care and retirement plans decreases significantly. In addition, freelancers, who comprise the largest segment of telecommuters, are not protected by labor laws . Unlike traditional workers, they are not entitled to overtime pay, minimum wage, worker’s compensation, or even anti-discrimination protections.\n",
            "[Doc 3655]: This is fundamentally a tax on consumption, the more resources in our society you consume the more you contribute to that society. The more material benefit you choose to gain from our society the more you give to it in return. You gain no material benefit by having a million pounds in the bank - only when you or someone else spends that money do you benefit - and you are then taxed on that benefit. At every stage your personal choice is involved in whether you pay tax.

            "[Doc 3049]: Being husband and wife doesn't mean you want to share every single facet of your identity. A spouse isn't completely trustworthy, they can turn abusive, they can secretly be manipulating you or pulling some kind of financial fraud against you. You always need things outside your marriage that you can use if it fails. Quite apart from that, when you get married you are still your own person, you can't let someone completely erode who you are. Your online presence should always be your own property because the Internet is for having a different identity, being anonymous, doing things you can't do in the offline world. To interfere with someone's online presence is to have too much control over them.\n",

            "[Doc 3557]: One reason to show that 18 year olds have a more mature mind then 16 year olds is because of the pressure of college and being on your own. When you are 18 you think about the life ahead of you which stresses you out because one day you will have to pay for everything and also if you are not yet in college you would rather have some money then your parents pay for an accident.

            "[Doc 508]: A related but separate criticism comes over Greenspan’s insistence on maintaining low interest rates throughout the 2000s. Greenspan followed conventional wisdom in keeping interest rates low after the dot-com bust and the September 11 attacks, a defensible decision. But he kept cutting rates for the next two years, even as the economy was out of the woods. The Federal Funds Rate dropped to a low of 1% in 2003 and did not begin the slow crawl back up until 2004. The low rates were a major contributor to the housing bubble. They helped heat up the economy, providing an initial boom but paving the way for eventual crisis.\n",

Even in paid areas we should not expect more privacy then you would at for example a resturant or a club that you pay to get in to. While people may well be going online in their own home the internet is not like your home and is as such much more open and accesable to others. This means that everyone should be very careful about what information they hand out and where.

As of lately*[when?*], however, there is also a rise in demand for long range low-cost flights and the availability of next generation planes that make long haul routes more feasible for LCCs. In 2013, ch-aviation published a study about the fleet strategy of low-cost carriers.*[citation needed*] They stated that major LCCs that order aircraft in large numbers get large discounts for doing so, and due to this they can sell their aircraft just a few years after delivery at a price high enough to keep their operating costs relatively low.*[clarification needed*]. Long-haul low-cost carriers are emerging on the transatlantic flights market with 545,000 seats offered over 60 city pairs in September 2017 (a 66% growth over one year), compared to 652,000 seats over 96 pairs for Leisure airlines and 8,798,000 seats over 357 pairs for mainline carriers \"Mainline (aeronautics)\").\n",

Another important thing to note: “Hybrid carriers will offer a traditional premium full service offering to all passengers on long haul routes such as meals, drink, seat back screens in economy and lie-flat beds with premium meals and amenities in business class,” says Petersen. Besides the hybrid category, AirlineRatings also ranks the full-service airlines, the low-cost carriers, airlines by cabin class and more. According to Petersen, the airline “still offers an outstanding economy experience, though it provides slightly less space per passenger compared to Korean Air.”. “Compared to other major carriers like the big three American airlines, Virgin offers fewer amenities,” says Petersen. “To be considered a best airline you have to be a seven star safety rated airline, and none of the airlines considered this year have changed their rating from last year,” says Petersen.\n",

            "================================ CORPUS TEXT =================================\n",
            "[Doc 725]: Small-change investment apps allow people to start saving earlier, and as is the case with most saving, time will grow your stash from small change into real money. Like Acorns, UK-based app Moneybox rounds up spare change from credit card purchases, saves it for you, and funnels it into investments. While small change sounds, well, small, let’s do the math. For example, say that the average user makes around 120 transactions per month and rounds up on average almost 40 cents per transaction. The small change adds up, as it’s nearly $48 saved each month and about $576 saved each year. Though not a significant enough amount of money to hurt your day-to-day dealings, over time, these investment apps will help your money will grow into something substantial.\n",
            "[Doc 526]: Small-change apps make investing accessible to everyone, without breaking the bank. Slightly over half ( 58% ) of American households own stocks, with 89% of the market belonging to households that earn more than $100K or more. Investment apps allow anyone with a smartphone and some spare change to have a chance to grow their money. Unlike mutual funds, most of which often require a minimum investment of $500-$5,000, these apps let you allocate mere pennies towards your investments if that’s all you have to spare. For example, the celebrity -sponsored app Acorns allows people to mindlessly invest their spare change, by rounding credit card purchases up and investing the extra change across a number of stocks. Such apps provide a solution for lower-income Americans to save.\n",
            "[Doc 929]: In addition to not requiring a lot of money, these apps also take away the technical and bureaucratic processes involved with investing. You don’t need a four-year degree in finance to invest successfully with small-change apps. Many people don’t have time to properly sit and study the market, which is why these user-friendly apps do the work for you. Apps like Stash do research on companies that support causes you believe in, categorizing them for you and making it easy to choose in what to invest. Additionally, you can make automatic payments through these apps, enabling investing without a second thought.\n",
            "[Doc 760]: Small-change investment apps usually restrict you to specific stocks or Exchange-Traded Funds. For long-term investment goals, such restrictions could confine your options. Additionally, when your income stream eventually goes up, you may want to diversify your portfolio in ways that the apps won’t allow. Your money should be working for you; if there’s a time in your life when you suddenly have money to invest (like after your wedding, or when your company gave you a car and you sold yours…) then investing in small-change stocks isn’t for you.\n",
            "[Doc 621]: Illustrious investor Warren Buffet has long warned people to “never invest in a business you cannot understand.” He has advised to only invest in companies that you already know about, which is difficult to do with small-change apps that often invest in companies of their choosing. Depending on apps to do your work for you may be advantageous in the beginning but will hinder you from learning the craft of investing long term and learning how to make real money by investing independently. When the time comes for you to invest more than just your spare change, how will you know with which investments to start? Practice makes perfect, and investment apps won’t give you that chance.\n",
            "[Doc 101]: Small-change apps often use algorithms and questionnaires to ascertain the level of their investors’ risk tolerance , and then proceed to invest the money accordingly. However, because this process is automated, many feel that the risk tolerance determined by the app may be inaccurate, leading to bad investment choices. While automated processes are often adept at detecting patterns (which is important for analyzing market trends), algorithms may not be as dependable when it comes to determining if those patterns are meaningful. This is where the human component would normally come in, but it’s missing from these apps. Investment already comes with risk , and using an automated, impersonal app rather than trading through a broker or financial adviser heightens this risk.\n",
            "[Doc 1967]: When it is politicians who control both the investment and the amount funds being returned from that investment then they have an incentive to encourage more investment. They will want more exploration to find more resources, they will promote technological advances to be able to extract more from the same fields, and they will be willing to grant more production licences. If on the other hand the money goes into a trust fund then the government and parliament has little incentive to encourage the market and every incentive to hold it up. The oil only provides a risk; unpopularity due to environmental impacts without any benefit in return. The result will be that the costs of drilling will be seen in the environmental damage it causes while communities do not get any of the benefit as the money is being squirreled away ‘for the future’. This is hindering the market and so reducing the economic benefits to the country.\n",
            "[Doc 2575]: There are thousands of education and tutoring applications on tablets, so teachers can tailor student learning to an individual style/personality instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. There are more than 20,000 education apps available for the iPad alone.\n",
            "[Doc 3366]: FInes are imposed with the purpose of dissuading and disincentivising the action for which they are being fined for. Funds for providing compensation to those affected by climate change will be collected from those who are directly involved in being responsible for causing climate change. This fine shall dissuade them from further causing climate change and therefore will help in containing climate change.\n",
            "[Doc 444]: Amazon allows small retailers to sell on its platform, thus providing them incomparable online exposure. In fact, almost half of internet users in the US live in a household with an Amazon Prime membership, and the site gets more than 2 billion visitors every month. How’s that for reach? In addition to new consumers, small business can’t ignore the benefits and tools that Amazon can bring them, like sales, marketing and branding pushes. It’s no wonder, then, that nearly 2 million small businesses in the US have started selling on the platform.\n",
            "[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban- whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.\n",
            "[Doc 711]: How we define ourselves is largely tied to the way we are viewed by the people surrounding us. This natural dynamic makes it harder to change and grow as the process isn’t solely internal. It also requires a change in others’ perceptions of us. Leaving your home country to live abroad provides the opportunity to introduce yourself to people that view you in a new way. They won’t have any preconceived notions about who you are, allowing for a completely fresh perspective of you as a person. This doesn’t mean you’ll become someone else, but it can enable you to take new steps in becoming the person you want to be. Returning home after a long period of absence may offer this same experience once more.\n",
            "[Doc 1152]: When contemplating iOS or Android, both have what to offer in terms of quality, but Android provides the quality at lower cost . For developers , publishing an unlimited number of apps through the Android marketplace is affordable at $25 – where iOS costs $99 for the same – and there is a higher percentage of free apps in Google Play Store than in the iOS App Store. This, combined with the fact that Android provides low-cost, quality handsets that are hundreds of dollars cheaper than iPhone’s newer models, makes the choice a simple one. The proof is in the numbers: Android holds almost 75% of market share around the world.\n",
            "[Doc 3880]: The effects of climate change will be worldwide. Terrorism, disease and malnutrition will only affect smaller groups, we should only act on the bigger problems. Climate change is not at all mild to all those affected by it. As deserts spread, the sea level rises and natural disasters become more frequent, millions of people will have to move. Climate change is in this way the underlying cause to many problems such as war and famine.\n",
            "[Doc 996]: The Android platform is an open-source system , which means you can have access to any apps you want, regardless of the maker – over a million more than iOS provides. Additionally, any phone carrier can create devices for Android, and users can download any available Android system. In contrast, as mentioned above, iOS is exclusive, mainly because it’s a closed-source system. This locks you in to using everything Apple once you commit to iOS; your devices will only be compatible with other Apple products, you can only troubleshoot technical issues in an Apple Store, and your available apps are limited to whatever Apple decides you should have.\n",
            "[Doc 1363]: If there wasn't advertising then small businesses would have no chance at all to make their product well known. Adverts can actually level the playing field - if you have a good new product, and market it in a clever way then it doesn't matter how small your company is, you can still make consumers interested. The more you restrict the freedom of information, the more this helps the large companies who everyone already knows about.\n",
            "[Doc 1955]: Business and the markets prize political stability. Clearly when the leader of a country is ill this stability is damaged but the damage can be mitigated by being transparent. The markets will want to know how ill the leader is, and that the succession is secure so that they know what the future holds. Secrecy and the consequent spread of rumour is the worst option as businesses can have no idea what the future holds so cant make investment decisions that will be influenced by the political environment. Leaders do matter to the economy; they set the parameters of the business environment, the taxes, subsidies, how much bureaucracy. They also influence other areas like the price of energy, the availability of transport links etc. It has been estimated that “a one standard deviation change in leader quality leads to a growth change of 1.5 percentage points”.\n",
            "[Doc 739]: While the appreciation of the value of certain assets depend on external markets, real estate is what you do with it. For example, you may not know if a company you’ve invested in is about to hire a new CEO whose decisions will ultimately drive the price of their stocks down. On the other hand, you can choose where to buy your property, how much you want to renovate it, who you want to rent to, and how much to invest in the upkeep; all of which can determine how good your investment is. In other words, the ability to profit from your real estate investment lies in your hands.\n",
            "[Doc 3481]: Yes, politicians form part of Parliament, and Parliament sets the laws, but we should not allow them to use the law as a point scoring technique with the public. The law works fine as it is. Yes there are a few unsatisfactory results, but this was decided by peers; members of the jury. They decide the cases based on the facts. The media picked up on these cases and has turned the public against the law of self defence but they are only seeing a snippet of what the law actually does in this area. We should not change the law because there has been one high profile case that the public were disgusted by. If the law gives a satisfactory result 99% of the time, then why change it for the odd case? The only reason the Tories want to change the law is to get the public on their side. But they should not meddle with a law that works just to win votes.\n",
            "[Doc 3282]: When disney change the ending of a fairy tale or other child's story they are changing what the author planned for the story. These so called \"happy ever after\" endings are unrealistic, unexciting and pointless! When a great children's story is produced it shouldn't be changed simply because it might make a child cry.

Many of these developments arose due to the focus on the human element of space travel; scientists had to focus on the very real challenge of getting humans into space and back home safely. While robots are very good at carrying out pre-designed programs and collecting data, their ability to think critically and engage in problem solving is quite limited. In order to get the most of space travel and exploration, humans must be present to add their critical thinking and physical capacity to missions.

Who knows, maybe the money saved on office planning could have been used to fund company fun days or other morale-boosting events.\n",

            "[Doc 109]: The majority of American adoption agencies offer some form of open adoption, and advocates and bloggers are quick to tout its benefits. However, there is little science to prove that children in open adoption scenarios are better off emotionally than adoptees with no connection to their birth families. A longitudinal study of adoptees at UMass Amherst revealed that there was no notable difference in self-esteem between children in closed and open adoptions. Additionally, an adoptee’s degree of preoccupation with their adoption had no correlation to the level of openness in their adoption.\n",
            "[Doc 2199]: Schools are playing an increasingly formative role, in the sense that they’re being tasked with not only knowledge transfer, but also the creation of behaviors and placing emphasis on teaching students how to apply their knowledge. The simple reason is that our kids are increasingly looking not to their parents, but schools and the environments they provide, for advice on how to live their lives.

            "[Doc 695]: In all relationships, each person involved must be open and honest with one another in order to fully understand their partner’s desires and experiences. Couples in open relationships tend to be more self-aware and honest with themselves about their own sexual desires because they have the freedom to explore them. Therefore, they are very open and honest when sharing their experiences – and maybe even more transparent to their partners, which enhances their communication . Monogamy, on the other hand, may hinder this type of open communication, as the structure of the relationship doesn’t carry as much of a push to be forthcoming with one another.\n",

            "[Doc 3059]: This debate is trying to point our attention to the fact that animals are not all that different from humans and that we should not presume that they have no sense of privacy. However, should we not take into account how an animal uses it's own privacy? If you look at how humans give birth, it is behind curtains. Often the family will not be in the room only the father of the child and he necessary doctors. If you look at how humans mate, it is confined to the bedroom. If you look to how we go to the toilet in times where we have choice, we go behind closed doors. Now, look at animals, animals do not hide, they show no shame. They mate in the open, they release their waste in the open and they give birth in the open. Given that this is how they treat their own privacy, why should we think that they value it? If they do not value their own privacy, why should we value it?\n",
            "[Doc 2380]: In a free market the core concept is freedom of choice. The consumer chooses what they want to buy. And by the same measure there needs to be freedom of choice for employers. They need to be able to decide what products to make, how to market them, and who to employ. Companies should be looking for those who are best qualified for the job rather than satisfying a government quota to provide temporary contracts to young people. Even if the government is paying for this employee they are still utilising the resources of businesses. Businesses will often have limited space so having some of that space taken up by mandated temporary workers is not the most productive use that the company could be making of that space. It is clear that this would be a ‘make work’ scheme because there are already only around two million vacancies, compared to five and a half million unemployed under 25s, in the entire European Union . Moreover that these vacancies exist shows that the real problem is with matching jobs and workers with the right skills. This is best done by training not temporary, probably unskilled, employment.\n",
            "[Doc 3066]: Much of the evidence that there is man made climate change is in the open. In the wake of climate gate and the other scandals there have been, scientists are likely to be even more open with how they compiled their results and how they came to their conclusions. Databases of temperature recordings etc will be open to access so that anyone can check the results a climate scientist gets. Transparency will prevent more far-fetched ideas, such as the too rapid melting of the Himalayan glaciers, being considered scientific so preventing these from undermining the credibility of rest of the body of science and reducing the ability of deniers to nitpick and find holes. Even if individuals don’t go and check the scientists’ work themselves simply having the evidence open to do so will help show that global warming is man made as scientists would not be making everything public if they knew they were likely to be shown to be lying about their results. The most important thing is that with their findings being questioned and under ever more scrutiny scientists will go and recheck their work or have others review it. This peer review process should help persuade the public that the scientists are not deliberately falsifying information and are producing results that are as accurate as possible\n",

            "[Doc 677]: It’s expensive to transform homes into smart homes. For starters, you’ll need to buy all new smart home appliances, devices, switches, and plugs to automate your lighting, climate control, security system, etc. Smart home maintenance may also put a dent in your wallet, since digitally integrated appliances and devices are often more expensive to repair than their traditional counterparts. This is because their technology is more delicate and prone to high-tech malfunctions, which can therefore need more frequent and sophisticated (i.e., costly) repairs.\n",

            "[Doc 94]: Smart homes greatly enhance people’s levels of safety. By being able to easily turn off any smart appliances from your phone – within seconds – there’s no more reason to panic when you’re out of the house and suddenly realize that you’ve left the oven on. (Some smart appliances have been designed to turn themselves off when not in use.) For greater security, you can remotely lock any home doors you forgot to lock. You can also use smart appliances to monitor your home – and your loved ones inside. So, whether you’re sitting in your office 30 minutes away or on a business trip abroad, you can view your child or pet from afar and exchange voice messages with them through a toy or device. Automated technology offers peace of mind to parents about caretakers or loved ones left by themselves.\n",
            "[Doc 590]: Smart home technology is more cost- and energy-efficient than traditional home appliances and electronics. Since connected appliances are designed to work with the least amount of energy needed, this cuts down on gas, electric and water bills. In fact, a US Environmental Protection Agency study reported that owners using smart home technology solely for thermostat control saved between 10%-30% on their energy bill. Take new sensor technology in smart shower systems , which saves money by maximizing water usage and minimizing waste.\n",
            "[Doc 162]: Besides the obvious risk of serious malfunctions in your smart home when your internet connection goes kaput (particularly worrying if one of your connected devices is a smart baby monitor ), there are other frustrations . For example, there’s no guarantee that all devices will sync with smart assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant, among others; getting various devices from different companies to work together can be more time-consuming than manually operating “dumb” appliances. Plus, the more devices you acquire, the more apps you’ll have to download and create separate accounts for, which can be tedious and burdensome.\n",

With the impact food labeling has on consumer choices, companies turned the issue on its head, producing food that is more in tune with what the people want and using labels to tell us about it. An example is PepsiCo’s “Smart Spot” program that is intended to help consumers identify healthier products – products the company developed as a consequence of consumer pressure for healthier drinks that contain less sugar. What is more, the strategy proved very profitable for the company, with the smart spot products sales increasing 13 percent or three times as fast as the rest of the business.\n",

            "[Doc 2246]: Having to wear smart clothes encourages children to respect their school and their teachers and behave themselves. This is because of the association between smart clothes and work. Casual wear at school can also make students feel over-relaxed and 'at home,' meaning they don't focus as much on work. A lot of schools are bringing back school uniform because they want to improve discipline. Moreover, school uniform can actively encourage students to enter into an adversarial relationship with the curriculum and their teachers. Exercising arbitrary control over children in the interests of “discipline” is likely to convince them that the very sensible, rational principles of learning and critical thought that they acquire during the school day are equally arbitrary and meaningless. By refusing to allow children to participate in enjoyable, beguiling processes of discovery and understanding unless they comply with unjustified and meaningless rules about dress, schools risk being seen as oppressive and capricious by their students.

Institutions like MIT are using Big Data analyses to build “ smart cities ” that will ultimately help reduce living costs, energy consumption and harmful environmental emissions, and generally improve quality of life . In 2013, Los Angeles replaced thousands of traffic lights with LEDs, which created a data system informing the city of every light’s status and traffic flow at all times. This system ultimately resulted in brighter streets, a smoother flow of traffic and, consequently, fewer traffic accidents. Saudi Arabia is using Big Data for adequate crowd control to prevent stampedes among the millions of Muslim worshippers who embark on an annual pilgrimage to Mecca.

This includes safety from exposure to X-rated materials , such as porn and excessive violence, as well as misinformation , including deep fakes , which they are too young to decipher. But even under close supervision, children can be exposed to such material on their own, especially on their or their friends’ smartphones ( TikTok , anyone?). While it’s true that there are many parent-control apps that filter and manage kids’ usage of smartphones, kids are smart, digital natives; they enjoy the challenge of coming up with new ways to bypass these measures .

Smart spending cuts ensured that the government would save instead of racking up debt, which created the largest national surplus in America’s history.\n",
            "[Doc 122]: As with any internet-connected device, smart homes are at risk of getting hacked. Each connected device notifies its corresponding app when it’s being used, sending a digital fingerprint to the router. Hackers monitoring your router can learn about your daily schedule and view videos/images of you or maps of your home. Such data can be beneficial to anyone wanting to break in or spy on your once intimate home life. (And what about the nightmare of hackers taking over control of your home?) A less frightening but still worrisome element is that your internet-connected devices, which are supposed to be serving you, are actually serving the needs of manufactures and tech giants.

This has traditionally lead to a concentration on books because a student can have their own book and carry it around easily.

This can boost their quality of life. By letting them utilize voice commands to power appliances or by putting control of their daily home needs at their fingertips, they can live more independently.

            "[Doc 970]: Jackson was great at thinking of new ways to play basketball. He came up with the Triangle Offense, which Chuck Klosermann called “the single most dominant offensive attack of the past 20 years.” It entails a team forming a triangle with the post, wing and corner players. Being disciplined about staying in formation, switching positions and smart passing make it incredibly hard to defend against. The Triangle Offense became legendary because of its effectiveness and how hard it was to pull off. Others tried to imitate it, but none could coach it like Jackson did.\n",

Inside or outside, dogs are always eager to join any game and will happily play with kids and adults for hours on end. And, unlike cats, dogs can play interactively; they’ll catch a ball and bring it back to you. Not only can dogs be easily trained to play and do tricks, but they can also be trained to do actual jobs that make a real difference in society. It helps that dogs are scientifically proven to be as smart as 2-year-old kids. In fact, research suggests that even puppies with little exposure to humans can already understand pointing gestures and are born with levels of social cognition – ready to work and play.\n",
            "[Doc 713]: Having walls surrounding employees while they work prevents distractions and provides an increased sense of security; the fear of being watched while you work is no longer relevant. In contrast, a completely open office space without any barriers can inhibit productivity . Researchers at Harvard have found that open work environments negatively affect collaboration, actually reducing face-to-face interactions by 70%. Plus, fewer screens or walls between employees, can lead to increased employee interruption, reduced levels of concentration and lower levels of motivation. Since it can take as long as 23 minutes for employees to get back on task and return to a fully engaged state, closed office layouts seem like a smart option to boost (and maintain) levels of concentration.\n",

            "[Doc 1556]: The problem is that when it comes to privacy it is not really our personal physical security that we are worried about. Part of the problem is that we value our right to a private life and that we should have control over that to the extent of being able to decide how much information others know about us. To a large extent this is an issue of trust; we (sometimes wrongly) trust our friends and others with information about us. We often trust faceless entities; companies and governments too though usually to less of an extent. But a lot of that trust is as a result of their willingness to tell us what they know about us, to provide information in return, or to provide methods for us to restrict what they know. In cases like this that trust has not been earned; we were not asked, and not obviously given anything back, and there seems little change of us changing the terms of the relationship.\n",
            "[Doc 486]: Even before the pandemic drove consumers online en masse, the migration of shoppers from brick-and-mortar stores to cyberspace was disrupting industries that had employed swaths of workers for decades. In recent years, pre-pandemic, large retailers like Macy’s and JCPenney’s laid off nearly 100,000 workers . In 2018, Toys ‘R’ Us was forced to close its doors due to many reasons, including e-commerce (though, after a painful bankruptcy, it has reopened two stores in the US). Experts have been wary that the internet and e-commerce sectors are not generating new retail jobs at the pace that they’re eliminating old ones. Many of those laid-off workers don’t have the technical skills required to pursue the kind of jobs the internet is creating a demand for, like blockchain, AI, data science, and UX design. As such, these workers are effectively locked into underemployment or unemployment.\n",
            "[Doc 1364]: Advertising has a positive role to play in modern society, helping us choose between competing goods. Many adverts are drawing our attention to products with new features, for example more powerful computers, telephones which are also cameras and music players, or foods with added vitamins. Other adverts try to compete on price, helping us seek out the cheapest or best value products. In most cases advertising does not make us go shopping – we would be planning to buy food, clothes, gifts and entertainment anyway. What advertising does is to help us make better decisions about how to spend our money, by giving us more information about the choices available.\n",
            "[Doc 1690]: The difference between us and other animals is a matter of degree rather than type . Their bodies resemble ours, as do their ways of conveying meaning. They recoil from pain, appear to express fear of a tormentor, and appear to take pleasure in activities; a point clear to anyone who has observed a pet dog on hearing the word “walk”. We believe other people experience feelings like us because they are like us in appearance and behaviour. An animal sharing our anatomical, physiological, and behavioural characteristics is surely likely to have feelings like us. If people have a right to not be harmed, we must ask ourselves what makes animals different? If animals feel what we feel, and suffer like us, to condemn one to testing because of them being of a different species is similar to racism or sexism.\n",
            "[Doc 634]: Religion is governed by man, holy man, but man nonetheless. If you believe God created us, then you need not look any further than our own minds and bodies to get a firsthand impression of his (or her) will. Our entire set of human capabilities enable us to explore the world and life. If we were meant to adhere to strict routines and re-exploration of the same literature, we could have managed with much less brain capacity than what God created for us. While there is sanctity and pureness in accepting and using the natural gifts we received, we don’t need organized religion to dictate to us how to use them. We can still believe in God without rote rituals telling us how to do so.\n",
            "[Doc 763]: In the past, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in 2018, the US was in bad company. Only the United Arab Emirates, an oil-rich Middle Eastern country with fewer people than Michigan, Puerto Rico, a US territory, and Comoros had higher top corporate tax rates than seen in the US. Now, the US rates among the UK (20 percent), China (25 percent) and Canada (28 percent). Before the corporate tax reduction, other countries had a competitive advantage over the US when looking to attract businesses. This is no longer the case and shows that raising tax rates may accelerate this trend, and every time a company moves overseas, it costs the US both jobs and tax revenue.\n",

In the last 10 years, nearly half of the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine have hailed from the US, a far higher rate than any other country. This trend dates back decades . Nobel Prizes are just one way to measure. In 2009, 40 percent of articles published in biomedical journals came from the US, three times as many as its nearest competitor.

But were the US to take a step down from the international stage, it would not be the UN that would fill the void. Russia and China, both uncommitted to humanitarian ideals, would step in – as they are currently jostling for power and influence in Ukraine and the Middle East . We need only to look back at the last time another superpower – the Soviet Union – challenged the US for global supremacy; only because of US protection was Western Europe able to thrive without falling to the grasp of Soviet tentacles.

This is omnichannel — a retail strategy designed to deliver a seamless, integrated experience for customers across every touchpoint of their interaction with your store. If previously AI-driven personalization was used to customize targeted offers, now it provides outstanding opportunities for e-commerce. The action point here is simple — retailers must prioritize how they collect, store, and use their customers’ data in order to stay competitive. Betting on voice search or voice commerce can help large retailers win the competition by increasing customer convenience. We’ve covered quite a few e-commerce trends in this article, and it’s up to retailers to decide which ones to try for their businesses.\n",

At the same time, many Amazon merchants are being lured to sell on Temu and fellow ecommerce newcomer **TikTok Shop** with the promise of lower fees and other perks like platform-funded discounts and the ability for sellers to use their own fulfillment services.\n",

If police forces with the proper training and resources to solve murders only manage to do so a fraction of the time, we can expect a much lower rate of success for untrained individuals with no access or witnesses in connection to those in question or to find them. One might be wiser to pursue an activity with a better return on investment than crowd-sleuthing. Moreover, crowd-sleuthing could be used for vengeance instead of virtue, even leading to the spread of conspiracy theories or information that should not be in the public domain .

            "[Doc 1286]: Many matadors are gored each year. In 2010, famed matador Julio Aparicio was gored in the throat by a bull during the Festival of Saint Isidro. The bulls horn went through his neck and throat and up through his mouth. Such gruesome scenes, and the risks that matadors must take with their lives, have no place in a modern society. The bullfighters perceived and praised as 'the best' are the ones that come closest to the bull, letting its horns pass inches by the fighter’s side, etc. The greater the risk for the bullfighter, the greater the reward from the crowd. The bullfighter is not trying to stay as far away as possible in order to make a riskless kill; they are trying to demonstrate their courage and bravery in the face of potentially fatal risks. This is yet another instance where, if the state did not step in, individuals would enter into certain activities which would be harmful to them. The need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community, which may lead many of them to take risks, and suffer injuries, they otherwise would not, for fear of losing 'face'. Bullfighting is just too dangerous to humans to allow, and so the state should step in and ban bullfighting to protect all those involved.\n",
            "[Doc 2138]: Personal autonomy has to be the key to this debate. If people want to smoke – and the owner of the public place has no issue with that – it is not the role of the state to step in. While smoking is dangerous, people should be free in a society to take their own risks, and live with their decisions. All that is required is ensuring that smokers are educated about the risks so that they can make an informed decision.\n",
            "[Doc 3789]: They are flavoring alcohol and cigarettes to attract a younger crowd. Will they do this with these. Will our children have to watch advertisements for cannabis or worse?\n",
            "[Doc 2786]: There is no evidence to show that prohibition is succeeding. The question we must ask ourselves is, \"What are the benefits of criminalising any drug?\" If, after examining all the available evidence, we find that the costs outweigh the benefits, then we must seek an alternative policy. Legalisation is not a cure-all but it does allow us to address many of the problems associated with drug use, and those created by prohibition. The time has come for an effective and pragmatic drug policy. Prohibiton causes crime syndicates to flourish. If legalisation was to occur, crime groups would have one of their major sources of income cut off, thus lessening their negative impact on society. Police would be able to spend more time arresting much more dangerous criminals, such as rapists and murderers. Overall, prohibition causes more problems than it solves.\n",
            "[Doc 3176]: Since the Labour domination in 1997, a lot has been made in the media of families who gain a lot of resources from the welfare state. Many people cite families that have vast amounts of children in order to gain more and more benefits. However, if we made breast feeding compulsory we could cut the level of benefits given to these families. If all of the nutrients that child needs are being gained for free, then less benefits would be needed in order to keep the child healthy. This would make people question whether or not scrounging off of the benefit system was a good idea with the benefit levels being so reduced. In this way, the child is not harmed.\n",
            "[Doc 1980]: Individuals are sovereign over their own bodies, and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals. Since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective, it is not up to the state to legislate in this area. Rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use, the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs.\n",
            "[Doc 3831]: The opposition has built their case on an assumption unemployed are only victims of circumstances and can’t influence the situation. Many of these people actually are just not stimulated enough to accept some job offers, because the benefits they receive provide them with the same amount of money as those offers. We can’t force them to accept these jobs if they can prove they are still looking for a job, so they continue to exploit working taxpayers. The opposition thinks the unemployed should just wait until the economy recovers by itself and starts offering wonderful job opportunities they were dreaming of. No one is willing to work for a minimal wage. The difference between receiving the benefits and working for a minimal wage is that the latter is a productive activity bringing benefits to the economy. The government could also use the tax revenue to boost the economy further. This process starts a chain reaction of working, earning, and spending, which revives the economy. The opposition doesn’t understand how work places are created in the economy. It is wrong to say there is no demand for labour. There could be no demand for the labour at the wages the unemployed demand. Companies can earn more by producing goods in other regions where people ask for less, boosting the economy there, for example in the South East Asia. Unemployed here demand too much for their level of productivity, so they are not competitive and are not worth the wages they wish for. Moreover, many of them are simply unskilled. It is easy to sit doing nothing receiving benefits and wining about the state of the economy. It is hard to motivate yourself to accept a job offer below your level of expectations or improve your skills. Those people need additional stimulus from the government to return to the labour market. The longer the unrestricted benefits are available, the longer it will take for the unemployed to find jobs, and revive the economy.\n",
            "[Doc 626]: Citizen detectives on the internet are a third column in crime prevention. Regular citizens taking an active interest in seeking out justice for others might cause people to think twice before committing a crime. For example, Canadian internet-sleuths prevented a teen in Norfolk, England, from committing an arson attack at his high school. These sleuths also help law offenders face consequences. In fact, some of the rioters who stormed the US Capitol building in 2021 were fired from their jobs after internet-sleuths found them online and publicized their identities . Casual social media users have long used social media as a tool to offer police agencies tips based on posts that allude to – or brag about – criminal activity. In this way, crowd-sleuthing harnesses the internet’s power of centralized information to provide a little extra protection for us all.\n",

            "[Doc 167]: Fossil fuels are considered some of the planet’s cheapest fuel sources. Sure, the process of extraction and refinement is expensive, but the return on investment more than makes up for it. Plus, today’s innovative technologies may now be able to use fossil fuels in ways that don’t pollute. Also, the constant state of fossil fuels’ molecular composition means they don’t form other compounds when stored in canisters for long periods. This makes them easy to store and safe to transport over long distances, either on trucks or pumped through pipes above and below ground. The same cannot be said about handling or transporting nuclear energy, whose risks outweigh its extremely high levels of energy density.\n",
            "[Doc 3120]: Every decision to preserve a building or a site of public historical interest necessarily prevents the possibility for future developments. The resources required to redevelop an existing site are frequently greater than the resources required to produce a new development, and it is crucial whenever a site is chosen for preservation that the benefits of preserving it outweigh the potential benefits of allowing new construction to appear in its place, or for resources to be put into alternative projects. An over-zealous approach to preservation, be it through architectural listing or restrictions on certain types of development can in fact stifle growth and prevent the development of areas which may seriously benefit from new investment and growth. It is a fitting irony that in 2006 the Department of Media, Culture and Sport exempted Fortress House, the then home of English Heritage, from listing: a location which has since been redevloped into modern offices. Similarly, the recent Grade II listing of the Milton Keynes shopping centre, thecentre:mk, has drawn complaints from its owners who have argued that future developments and improvements will now be severely restricted .\n",
            "[Doc 3828]: The purpose of social system is the help certain group of people who are not capable of securing their own needs or exercising their opportunities. Current unemployment benefits system fails because it has incorrect goal for the unemployment benefits and doesn’t serve its needs. The current system only gives monetary rewards for job you have done in the past and with condition that you are searching for a job. However the existing conditions do not achieve the goal of the program as many individuals decide not to work for a prolonged period and instead choose life on the welfare payments. The goal of unemployment benefits is secure proper ground for people who seeking for a new job and willing to become employed again and the program should be designed to reward the work searchers and discourage those that abuse the system. The group of people who should obtain those benefits is the one that are seeking the job but because of some reasons are not capable of getting it. Unemployment benefits help this group to exercise their opportunities while having enough funds to retrain and secure the living costs. As this group is incentivized but for some reason is not capable of exercising this opportunity, government has to help. We believe people mustn’t receive money just for the sake they have worked before. We still recognize that we have to take care of your basic needs if you are not capable of securing them, but we believe monetary funds should serve for the purpose of exercising your opportunities not as reward system. The harm of reward system is that it’s not incentivizing people to get back in job market while simply paying for not working. Opposition might argue that we already have reward systems i.e. But even in these cases we say these people receive money not because they have worked their whole life but because they are the age when they cannot secure their needs on their own and government has to help by monetary helping them.\n",
            "[Doc 1934]: Whilst the rich spend proportionately less of their income than the poor, the rest of their income is often invested in other areas and financial vehicles, boosting the economy in both the short and long term. In the short term this money allows businesses to take more risks owing to a greater pool of money to offset the risk, alongside lower interest rates. In the long term, these risks often lead to innovations that help the economy overall. In increasing the tax burden on the rich, the spending and investment that wealthy individuals partake in is cut off, preventing these areas of the economy from growing. Recessions and recession prevention are often reliant upon public perception of an economy’s general health and the extent of its exposure to less stable economies. Due to this feedback mechanism, it is possible, therefore, that an unfounded belief that tax rises could obstruct economic growth might cause panic amongst the media and the populace. A recession might come about through the mere expectation that there will be a recession. In fact, given that the majority of the media is controlled by the rich, it is within their best interest to report that there will be a crisis if there is a tax increase so that they can claim the policy was at fault in the future.\n",
            "[Doc 3863]: We wholeheartedly reject the Prop’s suggestion that legal abortions are safe and present a teen’s best option, and that the danger for pregnant minors is parental intervention. Admittedly, parents in our world aren’t always what we wish them to be, but we insist that they do more harm than good. The Prop has denied the immense risks associated with abortion, which stretch from acute hematometra (post-abortal syndrome) to breast cancer, infertility, and increased risk for clinical depression and suicide. The suicide rate is nearly six times greater among aborting women than among women who give birth. These findings refute the oft-heard claim that induced abortion is safer than childbirth.” The myth that childbirth is more risky than abortion is largely based on the way that statistics about abortion-related deaths are collected: such deaths are often attributed to present problems. These are risks that parents have a right and a responsibility to evaluate for their minor children, who are by law as well as by custom the responsibility of parents. So why should abortions need consent when a decision to keep the child doesn’t? Quite simply, the nature of pregnancy in most cases necessitates parental involvement, since it is rarely kept a secret, and almost always requires emotional and material support. The law need not step in where immediacy does. In truth, each of the options, including abortion, carry with them serious and long-term risks that need to be not only carefully considered, but offset with the kind of support a parent is best able to give.\n",
