It is difficult to give an accurate number on the cost of illegal immigrants for the rest of the population (the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has come up with numbers as high as $1,183 per household in the state of California1), but they are likely to put a strain on resources by not paying taxes whilst demanding social services such as healthcare and education. As a result, they take taxpayer's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state. Moreover, illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions. This is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down. Removing the illegal workforce would increase the number of jobs available to lawful residents and force employers to pay fair wages and provide safe working conditions."

However, having a conservative voice among news channels can make sense in theory, but Fox News' promotion of baseless conspiracy theories and reflexive partisanship can be damaging.\n\n[Doc 1000]: Fox News' promotion of conspiracy theories and its reflexive partisanship can be damaging to its credibility and its ability to provide balanced reporting. The network's hiring of former Fox executive Bill Shine to head White House communications also strengthened the perception that the network and Republican party were closely linked.\n\nThe summarization of the perspectives in the documents to the query \"Does Fox News add balance or propaganda to the media landscape?\" is as follows:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"claim\": \"Fox News adds propaganda to the media landscape\",\n        \"perspectives\": [\n            {\"text\": \"Fox News has been criticized for its lack of commitment to journalistic standards and its perceived bias towards conservative views.\", \"evidence_docs\": [560, 350, 987]},\n            {\"text\": \"The network's promotion of baseless conspiracy theories and reflexive partisanship can be damaging to its credibility and its ability to provide balanced reporting.\", \"evidence_docs\": [578, 1000]},\n            {\"text\": \"The network's hiring of former Fox executive Bill Shine to head White House communications also strengthened the perception that the network and Republican party were closely linked.\", \"evidence_docs\": [1000]}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"claim\": \"Fox News adds balance to the media landscape\",\n        \"perspectives\": [\n            {\"text\": \"Fox News provides a conservative viewpoint that is necessary for conservatives to challenge their own perspectives and engage with others.\", \"evidence_docs\": [350]},\n            {\"text\": \"Fox News is still closer to the mainstream than far-right networks, such as Infowars, and its ratings have held steady despite criticism.\", \"evidence_docs\": [987]}\n        ]\n    }\n] \n``` \nNote that I have reformatted the output to match the specified JSON format. \n\nHowever, I noticed that the provided JSON does not exactly match the expected output format. The expected output format requires the claim to be \"Does Fox News add balance or propaganda to the media landscape?\" instead of \"Fox News adds propaganda to the media landscape\" or \"Fox News adds balance to the media landscape\". \n\nHere is the corrected JSON output:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"claim\": \"Does Fox News add balance or propaganda to the media landscape?\",\n        \"perspectives\": [\n            {\"text\": \"Fox News has been criticized for its lack of commitment to journalistic standards and its perceived bias towards conservative views.\", \"evidence_docs\": [560, 350, 987]},\n            {\"text\": \"The network's promotion of baseless conspiracy theories and reflexive partisanship can be damaging to its credibility and its ability to provide balanced reporting.\", \"evidence_docs\": [578, 1000]},\n            {\"",
