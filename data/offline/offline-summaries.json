He and his wife, Melinda, have\n[Doc 1081]: Gates publicly stands for several ideals that directly contradict his lifestyle. Joining a list of other prominent billionaires, he famously spoke out against capitalism, criticizing the lack of attention paid to the poor and scientific innovation by the wealthy. This can be construed as hypocritic\n[Doc 92]: Because of his extensive donations to international projects, Gates has immense control over global health. His charitable Foundation contributes 10% of the World Health Organization ’s total budget, putting himself in a place to wield undue influence on the organization’s policies.
