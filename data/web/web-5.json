Co-creator David Crane summed it up: Friends leaned into emotion, while Seinfeld leaned into irony. The Friends team often felt like Seinfeld got looser rules when it came to pushing boundaries, while they faced stricter notes from NBC. With my due respect to seinfeld NOTHING could be compared to FRIENDS. I Have been watching friends on Daily basis since 2014 , never skipped a day ,, it’s my bed time story ,, I know exactly what the next sentence is and it still cracks me up. Do you expect anyone to vote for Seinfeld on a Friend's page? I like both but I rewatch Friends more. Friends is more dear to me;can watch a lot over n over. Courteney was on a Seinfeld episode but Jason Alexander was on a Friends episode too. Friends, immediately entertaining and watch to this day.",

Watching reality shows became a form of escapism. Then the time of TikTok arrived, and I started seeing videos claiming that \"the smartest person you know watches reality TV.\" I found that quite validating for me it meant, someone was acknowledging that there might be more depth to this guilty pleasure than people assumed.

But while film studios raced to combat the last few years of instability in the entertainment industry, this data analysis shows that opportunities for people of color fell across the board after recent gains, while women also saw a drop as writers, even as their share of lead roles increased.

Another look at investment found that like 2023, white women directors were more likely than white men or people of color to helm films with lower budgets; 45.5% of their films had budgets less than $20 million.",

With a consistent measure of student achievement, standardized exams allow for meaningful district comparisons and help maintain educational standards nationwide. Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge.",

U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona once said that tests can be a “flashlight” on what works in education, and Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera has similarly noted that “actionable data is the foundation for improving performance and holding our schools accountable.” Alongside other indicators of student performance, tests provide teachers with actionable data that can help inform their instruction, such as whether students might need more help or acceleration in a certain subject or part of a subject.",

Following changes that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, patients and clinicians might be asking more questions as a result.

Mainstream forms of Judaism view the practice as integral to the faith and one of the most important religious obligations, while differing schools of interpretation within Islam view it \"Khitan (circumcision)\") either as a religious obligation or recommendation. With the exception of the Coptics, Ethiopian Orthodox and Eritrean Orthodox where circumcision is a common, integral or required practice for members of these churches, the large majority of mainstream Christian denominations maintain a neutral position on it in with respect to medical or cultural reasons, although all of them honor the circumcision of Jesus and condemn the rite when it is viewed as a means or requirement towards an individual's justification \"Justification (theology)\").",

In this manner, CBT differs from many other forms of psychological treatment. 2. Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior. 3. People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives. CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns. CBT treatment also usually involves efforts to change behavioral patterns.

With respect to mood disorders, with depression as the most commonly examined disorder, nearly all meta-analyses showed that CBT was more effective than waiting list control conditions, but equally effective in comparison to other active treatment methods, such as reminiscence, (an intervention that uses recall of past events, feelings and thoughts to facilitate pleasure, quality of life or adaptation to the present; Peng, Huang, Chen, & Lu, 2009), psychodynamic therapy, and interpersonal therapy (Krishna et al., 2011; Wilson, Mottram, & Vassilas, 2008).",

One important aspect of CBT relates to perspective, says psychologist Jennifer Burbridge, assistant director of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Additional evidence shows CBT may help people with different health issues, including irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, insomnia, migraines, and other chronic pain conditions. CBT can help you adjust to your diagnosis, cope with the new challenges, and still live a meaningful life, despite the limitations,\" says Burbridge.

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture.",

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).",

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.",

Homework teaches students various beneficial skills that they will carry with them throughout their academic and professional life, from time management and organization to self-motivation and autonomous learning. Homework helps students of all ages build critical study abilities that help them throughout their academic careers. Homework is most effective when it allows students to revise what they learn in class. Homework also helps students develop key skills that they’ll use throughout their lives:. The skills learned in homework can then be applied to other subjects and practical situations in students’ daily lives. Homework helps parents track what their children are learning in school. According to a study, homework in primary schools has a minimal effect since students pursue unrelated assignments instead of solidifying what they have already learned. There are many pros and cons of homework, so let our tutors at Oxford Learning can help your family create great homework habits to ensure students are successful at homework.",

However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity.",

Certainly, no one has accused Stanford's admissions officers of being racist, so perhaps the real problem with affirmative action is that we are pretending to solve a problem that no longer exists.

The story of Botox begins with *Clostridium botulinum*, the bacterium responsible for producing botulinum toxin. By the 1950s, Dr. Vernon Brooks discovered that botulinum toxin type A could inhibit the release of neurotransmitters, leading to muscle paralysis. The botulinum toxin makes its way into the ends of nerves that control muscle contraction. In cosmetic dermatology, Botox is primarily used to diminish dynamic wrinkles—those formed by the contraction of muscles and wrinkling of the overlying skin, such as frowning, squinting, or raising eyebrows.",

Learning what’s inside of a cell phone can be a way for students to learn about the technology they use every day, and how it can be beneficial for communication and networking. This includes choosing specific educational content for students, designating device-free time in classrooms and at home, and modeling proper expectations and behavior for phone use.

For instance, during each season of any professional sport, there are away games that keep players from their families.

Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his 2020 $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. **The Bottom Line:** While it seems like there’s no way to stop such inflated salaries of professional athletes, the repercussions could cause long-term damage to professional sports.",

Roger Federer, who is now retired, won his first ATP title in 2001; whereas Nadal won his first in 2004; and Djokovic 2006. He not only completed the career grand slam to match Federer and Nadal but he also held all four grand slam titles at the same time. Filed Under: World Sport Tagged With: Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Who is the greatest men’s tennis player of all time? I could say exactly what you said when Nadal led Djokovic 22 to 20 in Grand Slam singles titles won, when Djokovic fans couldn’t care less about that statistic at the time. IF 2 GRAND SLAM SINGLES TOURNAMENTS WERE PLAYED ON CLAY INSTEAD OF HARDCOURT, NADAL WOULD HAVE EASILY WON MORE GRAND SLAM SINGLES TITLES THAN DJOKOVIC.",

Although college athletes are now allowed to profit from NIL contracts, they still cannot receive pay-to-play salaries from their schools. Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work. Next, take a look at the arguments in favor of paying college athletes for their work — with the emphasis on the word “work.” Collegiate sports do indeed represent a considerable commitment of time and effort, often resembling a full-time job. If few college athletes receive scholarships and fewer still receive full scholarships, and considering that playing college sports can be equivalent to a full-time job, then an argument could indeed be made that college athletes should receive salaries for their work.",

Congressional sponsors, as noted, claim that the substitution of broad-based federal taxation for private health insurance costs would result in most American families paying less for health care than they do today. For example, scholars at the Urban Institute, a prominent liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that a single-payer program would require a federal spending increase of $34 trillion over ten years, and total American health care spending would increase by $7 trillion. In summary, the adoption of a single-payer system covering more than 330 million Americans, particularly as outlined in the leading House and Senate bills, would guarantee a massive disruption of existing public and private health care coverage and delivery systems.",

Public support for the death penalty does not necessarily mean that taking away the life of a human being by the state is right.

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to place primary responsibility with the states for redistricting, but it also clearly preserves the ability of Congress to set federal rules as appropriate. Numerous states have had to redistrict following judicial rulings that their maps violate principles of the Constitution or other laws around redistricting. In Rucho v Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively leaving it up to plaintiffs to prove that any redistricting harm stems from something beyond party affiliation. Redistricting is a state process but is also governed by the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and judicial precedent. In most states, the legislature is responsible for drawing both their congressional and legislative district lines, typically through the standard lawmaking process and often subject to gubernatorial veto.",

According to Rufus King, “It was with the people that the Constitution meant to place the election of the Chief Magistrate.” The Constitution’s Electoral College Clause (Article II, section 1, clause 3) stipulates that electors from each state shall elect the president. However, most states adopted popular election of presidential electors in the 1810s and 1820s. Abolishing the Electoral College, however, would change the structure of the presidency to make it easier for popularly elected presidents to concentrate power in the executive branch. But the fact remains that a majority of the Electoral College elect’s presidents, not a majority of all Americans. Abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote would strengthen a president’s claim to speak for a majority of the American people.",

Most controversies involving the Electoral College occurred when candidates win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College vote. The NPVIC is a legally binding agreement among states to award the electoral votes from their state to the national popular vote winner, regardless of whether the majority of voters in that state preferred another candidate. The NPVIC would only go into effect should the states in the agreement represent an electoral majority of at least 270 electoral votes.

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful.",

There are two things Putin did that cemented the loyalty of Solzhenitsyn and other Russians—he restrained the billionaires who were looting the country, and he restored Russia’s standing abroad. Putin came to call these people “state-appointed billionaires.” He saw them as a conduit for looting Russia, and sought to restore to the country what had been stolen from it. Putin became president a half a year after Yeltsin was maneuvered into allowing the dismemberment of Russia’s ally, Serbia, and as he entered office Putin said: “We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians, or any threat to the integrity of the country.”. The degradation of Russia’s position represented by the Serbian War is what Putin was alluding to when he famously described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” This statement is often misunderstood or mischaracterized: he did not mean by it any desire to return to Communism.",

And yet, from Putin’s point of view, what he would say is, “I hear these things from presidents, they all say these things, but the policy stays the same.” And I think he has come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter who is president because America is still going to do what America does, and that the president can say whatever they want, but it doesn’t change that.",

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

More relevant when evaluating a free trade agreement are economic outcomes — and from that perspective, NAFTA looks pretty good.",

Cooper’s report also found that “the Raise the Wage Act would disproportionately help workers in poverty or near the poverty line” because “nearly half (46.7 percent) of all workers who would be affected by raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 have total family incomes within 200 percent of the poverty line,” demonstrating that raising the minimum wage would directly affect the working poor who have long been oppressed by stagnant wages. While there is validity in the fear that raising the minimum wage could negatively affect the working poor, through the impact a higher income would have on their means-tested benefits, using this fear as a justification for not pushing toward a higher minimum wage would be in service of systematic inequality.",

Digital marketing uses multiple channels and technologies that allow an organization to analyze campaigns, content and strategy to understand what’s working and what isn’t – typically in real time. ## Who's using digital marketing?

Retailers use digital marketing to see who their customers are and understand their shopping patterns in real time. In the TMT industry, digital marketing is helping companies better segment and automate marketing messages, as well as analyze social media conversations and call center transcripts to make customized, relevant offers that help decrease costly churn.

Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between legacy carriers and LCCs is that legacy carriers typically have extensive loyalty programs designed to entice their highest-profit customers to keep their flying within that airline and its partners rather than shopping around for the cheapest flight for each trip.",

Some micro-investing apps make algorithmic-based investment recommendations—also often referred to as artificial intelligence (AI) generated recommendations—for you based on your information and answers to questions about your goals, risk tolerance and financial circumstances. Depending on the app you use, your fund transfers might have to reach a certain threshold before they’re invested, but this level is usually quite low. Be aware that all apps aren’t created equal.** Micro-investing apps vary in available investments, fees and ease-of-use. To contribute to an investing app, you must provide the platform with access to other financial accounts. If an investing app tries to debit your account when the balance isn’t sufficient, you could face overdraft fees. Avoid over-trading.** The ease-of-use and design style of micro-investing apps might encourage investment choices based on emotion rather than sound rationale.",

Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.
