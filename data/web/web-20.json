Sep 17, 2024 · The review and analysis of Game of Thrones , the epic fantasy show that marked a turning point in TV production. Feb 10, 2025 · In 1996, George R.R.

Tyrion Lannister, the deformed son of the royal family, is one of the most intelligent and cunning men, and rarely acts not for the good of the Seven Kingdoms .

I’m surprised it did as well as it did, because “Gladiator II” had more than the usual number of problems: 1) The protagonist of the original film was dead, so the movie needed a new leading man; 2) The premise, without going into detail, was absurd; and, most importantly, 3) Paul Mescal didn’t seem like a tough guy. **Hello, Mick:** I have recently watched two productions of “Cape Fear.”  The first starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the second starring Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro. **Hello, Warren:**Mitchum was great in the original “Cape Fear” (1962), but Martin Scorsese’s 1991 remake starring Robert De Niro is the better movie. 3) Often, the more companies involved, the better the movie.",

Fact: Probably not, but it depends on the cause of your pain. ### Myth: Back pain is caused by sitting on a fat wallet. Fact: Frequently sitting with a large wallet in your back pocket can cause leg or hip pain and numbness, but it doesn't usually cause back pain. Compression of the nerve causes pain or numbness while sitting or driving. Fact: Back pain is usually caused by muscle strains or sprains, not by a serious condition like a disc or vertebrae issue. Fact: Back pain is often caused by issues that aren't relieved with surgery. ### Myth: A firm mattress is the best for alleviating back pain. ### Myth: Poor posture doesn't contribute to back pain. These habits can strain muscles and joints, causing body pain over time.",

Using a multidisciplinary theoretical framework (objectification theory, scripting theory, and Black feminist epistemologies), this article explores the fashion aesthetic, imagery, and celebrity culture of two major African American female hip-hop megastars, Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliott, to examine how the sexual politics of hip-hop culture has helped to define their sexuality, agency, and subjectivity. By examining the style and professional choices that fashioned their careers in hip-hop media, we explore the extent to which they have refuted, or submitted, to the distorted view of African American female sexuality, and thus contributed to their objectification or empowerment.

The divisive tone of cable news has become the very nature of its appeal, and this type of journalism hardens polarization because “the more political media one consumes, the more warped their perspective of the other side becomes.” Partisans tend to view each other negatively because polarized media weaponizes the differences between political and social groups instead of emphasizing commonalities.

A 0.05 rise in Fox ratings increased Republican vote shares by 0.5% in elections. Fox News influenced presidential, Senate, House, and gubernatorial races. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the effect of Fox News Channel (FNC) on the mass public’s political preferences and voting behavior in the United States from 2000 to 2020. We show that FNC has shifted the ideology and partisan identity of Americans rightward. This shift has helped Republican candidates in elections across levels of U.S. government over the past decade. Our estimates suggests that an increase of 0.05 rating points in Fox News viewership, induced by exogenous changes in channel placement, has increased Republican vote shares by at least 0.5 percentage points in recent presidential, Senate, House, and gubernatorial elections. ## Data availability.

According to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary, a sandwich is “two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between.” Now, what about a hot dog?

This helps schools benchmark their students' educational outcomes against a broad sample used during the standardization process. 5. With a consistent measure of student achievement, standardized exams allow for meaningful district comparisons and help maintain educational standards nationwide. Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge.",

          "content": "1. Data Helps for Teaching Improvement Standardized tests give teachers measurable data to understand how well their students grasp core concepts. This data can help teachers identify areas where students struggle and adjust their teaching methods accordingly. For example, a teacher can use standardized test results to determine that many students struggle with fractions. Using this data, the teacher can add more fraction-focused lessons and extra support. 2. A Progress Checkpoint for Students These tests benchmark students’ progress over time in key academic areas like math, reading, and writing. Students can track their year-over-year progress. This helps them recognize strengths, set goals, and grow academically. For example, a student who struggles with writing may see their improvement over the years through standardized testing results. 3. Valuable Insights for Parents Parents benefit from standardized test results, as they provide a sense of where their child stands compared to their peers—locally, provincially, and nationally. This comparison also gives insight into the school’s performance, helping parents make informed decisions about their child’s education . See full list on oxfordlearning.com 1. Major Source of Stress Test anxietyis real, and for many students, standardized tests represent a high-pressure event that can affect their performance. Teachers also feel this pressure, as the stakes of standardized tests can impact their evaluations and, in some cases, even school funding. 2. Unhealthy Competition Standardized testing often creates a competitive environment among students, schools, and districts, shifting the focus from collaborative learning and student development to ranking and performance scores. 3. Doesn’t Measure Intelligence Standardized tests are often valued for objectivity but don’t measure a student’s intelligence or potential. Research from Harvardreveals that socioeconomic status is a more reliable predictor of SAT scores than schooling or grade level. This suggests that wealthier families may have greater access to test preparation resources, creating an uneven playing field and limiting the test’s fairness.

Conservative author Dinesh D’Souza states: The term 'political correctness' seems to have originated in the early part of this century, when it was employed by various species of Marxists to describe and enforce conformity to preferred ideological positions. What is the underlying aim of political correctness? Few on the left would reject “the basic underlying aim of political correctness, to redistribute power from strong to the weak , just as to some extent the role of government is to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor” (Browne, 2006, p. 40). Why is political correctness a problem? Political correctness (PC), which took hold in the nineties, has rendered us all but ineffective in our pursuit of communicating with one another. There is more gossip, hurt feelings, misunderstandings, and intolerance because we do not actually know how to engage with one another when the going gets tough.

The objector claims that *even if* the fetus has a right to life, it simply does not follow that abortion is morally wrong. So far we’ve discussed the way that the violinist case can be used to defend the permissibility of abortion in the face of the argument from a right to life. The central innovation of this argument against the moral permissibility of abortion is that it proceeds without claiming that the fetus is a person, that the fetus has moral status, or that the fetus has a right to life. Like the argument from loss, this argument aspires to settle that abortion is morally wrong without addressing the thorny question of whether a fetus is a person, or has moral status. The argument aims to establish that *even if* fetuses have a right to life, then nevertheless abortion is permissible.",

In recognizing the right to abortion, *Roe* was consistent with earlier Supreme Court rulings recognizing a right of privacy that protects intimate and personal decisions—including those affecting child-rearing, marriage, procreation, and the use of contraception—from governmental interference. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court struck down Texas’s criminal ban on abortion and held that the right to abortion is a “fundamental right.”1In the 7–2 opinion, the Court held that, along with decisions relating to marriage, contraception, education, and family relationships, the decision about whether to continue or end a pregnancy is fundamental to “personal liberty.”2 In doing so, the Court recognized the great “detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice,” including the health and economic risks of being forced to continue a pregnancy.3.",

Instead of “repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*“, the Court could simply have rejected viability as the point at which the state’s interest in protecting potential life outweighed the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, and upheld Mississippi’s right to ban abortions after 15 weeks.",

Clinicians who provide obstetric care are in the best possible position to consider all factors when attempting to predict viability either when establishing a pregnancy diagnosis or assessing later in pregnancy. There is no definite diagnosis of viability and no test that can definitively determine whether a fetus could survive outside of the uterus, so determining whether a pregnancy is viable beyond the first trimester is often based on clinical judgment. Viability is just one factor that patients and health care professionals use when considering whether to proceed with or end a pregnancy, and gestational age is only one factor considered when estimating viability.",

A high-functioning and effective national laboratory system includes CDC working closely with state and local public health entities as well as clinical laboratory companies and is critical to providing timely and actionable data to protect public health, particularly at the onset of emergency responses and testing surges. Leveraging the public health workforce, lab capabilities, and data analytics, CDC must be operationally response-ready to monitor, respond to, and address global and domestic threats. Another key element to CDC’s preparedness and response priority in need of additional authority is improving public health data capabilities at the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels.",

ADHD(多动症，注意力缺陷多动冲动障碍）属于神经发育障碍，是生理问题，但是ADHD患者往往伴随很多心理障碍。（ADHD的基本科普大家可以看我这个回答）. 「多动症(ADHD)」是如何产生的，主要有哪些症状，应当如何诊断和治疗？. **事实上，ADHD的诊断是一个非常复杂的“工程”，即使量表符合ADHD诊断，还需要有经验的医生进行病史采集、观察访谈、实验室检查和心理评估等等**。. 所以说，很多人都会认为自己是ADHD。事实上，儿童ADHD患病率大约是3%~5%，而成年ADHD患病率才2.8%。. 还有研究者把执行功能分成行为激活、集中注意力、努力、情绪调节、工作记忆、执行的能力(Brown,2005)。. 2.

The third wave of the body positivity movement arose around 2012 largely as a response to the increase in social media culture and advertisements. The body positivity movement aims to change societal and individual perceptions of weight, size, and appearance to be more accepting of all bodies regardless of their diverse characteristics.

Bradimus' answer of \"body positivity\" is good, but relates a general attitude or approach - *all* bodies are good. The phrase \"body-shaming\" has taken on a life of its own and that affects the nature of the antonym, which often is awkward to express as an action. Personally, I would use the term/phrase \"Body glorification\" (or \"Body praising\" as user46359 stated), as that more accurately represents the exact opposite connotation of \"Body shaming\" and is immediately clear that the connotation is not just positive, but is in fact exceedingly positive. If you ignore the face-value meaning of the phrase \"Body positivity\" implying a somewhat positive connotation to bodies, then **\"Body positivity\" *is* the antonym for \"Body shaming\"**, at least with respect to common usage on social media.",

Montessori classrooms include students through the high school level, with an 18-year-old student being the oldest to learn in this type of educational environment. The school serves students from transitional kindergarten all the way through 8th grade, and in order to fulfill the values brought forth by Montessori, DMCS relies on low teacher-to-student ratios, family participation, multi-age classrooms, a diverse curriculum, and differentiated learning for each student (“Dixon Montessori Charter School,” n.d.).",

Maria Montessori began developing her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in pedagogy at the University of Rome and learning educational theory.: 60 While visiting Rome's mental asylums during her schooling with a teacher, Montessori observed that confined children were in need of more stimulation from their environment. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12. Montessori education involves free activity within a \"prepared environment\", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child. Montessori education for this level is less developed than programs for younger children. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lillard, Angeline S (2013), \"Playful Learning and Montessori Education\" (PDF), *American Journal of Play*, vol.

Schools and educators generally use the term “Montessori” to mean observing children given freedom in an environment prepared for their self-directed activity. While modern conventional Montessori teaching is limited and bound to “personality” or “culture,”, the International Montessori Society (IMS) uses the term “scientific education” to refer to what Dr. Montessori was originally practicing in her first Children’s House, which brought about the child’s true nature. In fact, later research has revealed that this type of scientific education is committed to laws of nature, which is the unique “scientific” environment that allowed the child’s true nature to emerge in Dr. Montessori’s breakthrough discovery in 1907.",

These non-renewable fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas, supply about 80 percent of the world’s energy. **Natural gas:** An odorless gas composed primarily of methane, natural gas often lies in deposits that, like those for coal and oil, formed millions of years ago from decaying plant matter and organisms. As a result, natural gas has surpassed coal to become the top fuel for U.S. electricity production, and the U.S. leads the world in natural gas production, followed by Russia and Iran. Governments around the world are now engaged in efforts to ramp down greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Considering the world's continuing dependence on fossil fuels, many argue that in addition to efforts aimed at replacing them, we also need to suck carbon from the air with technologies such as carbon capture, in which emissions are diverted to underground storage or recycled before they reach the atmosphere.",

Items like personal cubicles or designated workstations that seemed like a better fit for the \"private office\" argument will start making an appearance in these spaces as a way to keep employees safe and productive. Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

Closed office layouts section off private workspaces, each employee with a designated office or cubicle at the very least. ## Closed Offices with Modular Solutions. Modular building solutions, such as partitions, demising walls, and modular offices, offer a quick fix and an affordable approach to creating closed office spaces. If you’ve tried open offices, but they’re leading to low employee satisfaction or reduced productivity, then modular structures allow for a fast solution. Allied Modular specializes in these kinds of fixes, and provides businesses the ability to customize their office layouts the way they see fit. The debate between open office vs closed office layouts will likely continue for some time. However, the benefits of closed offices, particularly when paired with modular solutions, make them an appealing choice for businesses looking to enhance productivity, privacy, and overall employee satisfaction.",

The space was designed to benefit the business owners who were investing in the office solutions—who, ironically, are not required to work in this hectic environment. Clearly, an open-plan layout doesn’t benefit a company or anyone employed there. But, no one would rather be caged in an office cubicle either. So, the open office plan isn’t necessarily dead; it’s undergoing changes. So, are more companies introducing the open-plan office because of its “benefits” and objectives or simply just its trendiness?

While your baby is getting supplemental feedings, it’s a good idea to pump your breast milk so you can start nursing as soon as baby is ready.

The most succinct description of this phenomenon and the importance of experiencing infections in the first few years of life can be found in the subtitle of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine: “Please, Sneeze on My Child.” Some people fear that because vaccines prevent natural infections, the maturation of Th1 cells might be affected, thus causing children to develop allergies or asthma (this is often referred to as the “hygiene hypothesis”). The answer is that although immune cells, like those that make antibodies, are typically generated where the vaccine is given, they travel throughout the body, offering protection at the many sites where infection might occur.",

And I think about how I’m going to look at my wife when I get back home, and how she’ll know I’m seeing her — really seeing her — for the first time all over again. It’s probably too much to say that my ego was gone — I don’t think it works like that. People say that a single ayahuasca trip is like a decade of therapy packed into a night. I keep thinking about this idea that a night of ayahuasca is like a decade of therapy. I don’t know what life will be like in six months or a year, but I think ayahuasca was the greatest thing that has happened to my marriage.",

The debate surrounding assisted suicide has become a focal point in discussions about patient autonomy and the principles of healthcare ethics. It delves into the role of physicians in assisted suicide and considers the potential societal implications of legalizing this end-of-life option. Supporters of assisted suicide argue that terminally ill patients should have the freedom to determine the circumstances of their death, just as they have control over other aspects of their medical care throughout their lives. In conclusion, the ethical arguments against assisted suicide emphasize the importance of preserving the sanctity of life, protecting vulnerable populations from potential abuse, and maintaining the integrity of the medical profession. These alternatives allow physicians to address patients’ end-of-life concerns and suffering without directly participating in assisted suicide. The legalization of assisted suicide has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond individual patient care, affecting vulnerable populations, healthcare resource allocation, and societal perceptions of death and dying.",

Research published in the *High School Journal* indicated that students who spent between 31 and 90 minutes each day on homework “scored about 40 points higher on the SAT-Mathematics subtest than their peers, who reported spending no time on homework each day, on average.”.",

Homework is a powerful tool to help narrow these inequities, giving children from all backgrounds the opportunity to keep learning when they are not in school. At this point, some teachers may be saying, “I can’t get my kids to hand in a worksheet, let alone rely on them to learn on their own.” And of course, effective use of homework in class relies on creating a strong system of accountability for getting kids to do it. This should include a schoolwide grading policy—at Success schools, missing and incomplete homework assignments receive a zero; students can get partial credit for work handed in late; and middle and high schoolers can revise their homework for a better grade—as well as consistently and explicitly noticing when kids are or are not prepared and offering praise and consequences.",

Beyond the state sales tax, many consumers face a separate and distinct local tax levied specifically on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Unlike the general sales tax, SSB taxes are typically structured as a specific excise tax, meaning a fixed monetary amount is applied per fluid ounce of the beverage, not as a percentage of its price. The general state sales tax uses the ad valorem method, calculating the tax as a percentage of the beverage’s sales price.

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture.",

At any rate, the point to be made here is that torture is a terrorist tactic, and for a liberal democracy to legalise and institutionalise it, i.e. weave the practice of torture into the very fabric of liberal democratic institutions, would be both an inherent contradiction – torture being an extreme assault on individual autonomy – and, given what we know about the practice of torture in military, police, and correctional institutions, highly damaging to those liberal democratic institutions.",

But many states have failed to criminalize torture as a specific offence under their national laws, and governments around the world continue to defy international law by torturing people. For more than 50 years Amnesty International has been documenting torture, exposing the perpetrators and helping victims get justice. In 2006, years of campaigning by Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation led to the EU adopting the world’s first legally binding regulation for controlling the trade in the ‘tools of torture’. ## Why do governments torture? In Cameroon for example, Amnesty has documented how the security forces have set up secret torture chambers for people accused, often with zero evidence, of being members of the armed group Boko Haram.

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).",

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.",

Even under the “legalization” model, Nevada has the highest prostitution arrest rate per capita, at 95.3 arrests per 100,000 residents.**2** This model may work for those who are able to participate, but it is not beneficial for all people engaged in the sex industry, nor does it carry broader public safety benefits that reach beyond the rural communities with brothels.

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry.",

The **chicken or the egg** causality dilemma is commonly stated as the question, \"which came first: the chicken or the egg \"Egg (biology)\")?\" The dilemma stems from the observation that all chickens hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens.

A single-celled organism called *Chromosphaera perkinsii* appears to possess a embryonic process similar to animal mitosis, even though the organism separated from animal’s evolutionary line a billion years ago. * While this similar process suggests that animals inherited their own version of the ability from their single-celled ancestors, scientists can’t rule out the possibility that this could be another case of convergent evolution. However, scientists from Switzerland and the U.S. have discovered that this animal contained genetic instructions from embryonic development, meaning that the eggs existed even before life itself. “This paper gets at the core question of developmental biology, which is how we go from one cell to a whole animal, by looking at a related process in a weird, microbial relative to animals,” John Burns, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory in Maine said in a press statement.",

It’s that old riddle that’s sparked many arguments through the ages: was it the chicken or the egg that came first? It’s such a tricky question because you need a chicken to lay an egg, but *chickens come from eggs,* leaving us with an intractable circle of clucky, feathery life that apparently has no clear starting point. ## The first eggs. (This leaves us with another eggsellent question: which came first, the amniote or the amniotic egg? Back to our original question: with amniotic eggs showing up roughly 340 million or so years ago, and the first chickens evolving at around 58 thousand years ago at the earliest, it’s a safe bet to say **the egg came first**. ## The first chicken eggs. Eggs certainly came before chickens, but *chicken* eggs did not—you can’t have one without the other.",

But eggs – which are just female sex cells – evolved more than a billion years ago, whereas chickens have been around for just 10,000 years. Taken at face value, there is no doubt that the egg came before the chicken. Even the specialised sort of eggs laid by birds, with their tough outer membrane, evolved more than 300 million years ago. The wild ancestor of chickens is generally agreed to be a tropical bird still living in the forests of Southeast Asia called the red junglefowl –  with other junglefowl species possibly adding to the genetic mix. ## Sign up to our weekly newsletter ## More on Which came first, the chicken or the egg?",

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were among the first drugs developed to treat depression.

They estimated that slow tapering of antidepressants plus psychological support such as therapy could prevent one in five patients from relapsing, compared with going cold turkey, or tapering the dosage in under four weeks. Experts who were not involved in the study urged caution when interpreting the results, highlighting the proven effectiveness of antidepressants – and the real risk of relapse for people who have already had depressive episodes. “We know from long-term cohort data that roughly 60 to 70 per cent of people who have a first episode of depression will have a further episode over time, and good continuation trials suggest that maintenance antidepressants roughly halve that risk,” said Sameer Jauhar, a clinical associate professor in affective disorders and psychosis at Imperial College London.",

MAOIs block the effects of monoamine oxidase enzymes, and increases levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain.

Overall, the analysis found moderate-quality evidence that after successful treatment of depression, slow tapering of antidepressants combined with psychological support prevented relapse over the following year to a similar extent as remaining on an antidepressant at standard doses (either with or without psychological support). The researchers estimated that slow tapering of antidepressants plus psychological support could prevent one relapse in every five individuals compared with abrupt stopping or fast tapering (the two least effective strategies)—offering a clinically meaningful benefit.

It’s no secret students often find themselves grappling with high levels of stress and anxiety throughout their academic careers, so understanding the extent to which homework affects those stress levels is important. Over the years, numerous studies investigated the relationship between homework and stress levels in students. One study published in the Journal of Experimental Education found that students who reported spending more than two hours per night on homework **experienced higher stress levels and physical health issues**. Homework-induced stress on students can involve both psychological and physiological side effects. **• Sleep Disturbances**: Homework-related stress can disrupt students’ sleep patterns, leading to sleep anxiety or sleep deprivation, both of which can negatively impact cognitive function and emotional regulation. **• Effective Time Management**: Encourage students to create a structured study schedule that allocates sufficient time for homework, breaks, and other activities.",

This federal policy failure leaves more than 100 million people — 80 percent of U.S . workers — without paid time off after the birth or adoption of a child. Nearly half ... How much maternity leave does a mother get? A 2023 study of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, including the United States, found that mothers receive, on average, approximately around 19 weeks of paid maternity leave. The United States is the only country of OECD’s 38 member countries that does not guarantee any paid maternity leave. Should the United States prioritize paid parental leave? If countries with comparable GDPs, such as China and Germany, and similarly demanding work cultures, like Japan, can prioritize paid parental leave, there seems to be no justification for the United States not doing the same . Which countries offer 100% maternity leave? Significantly, several of the OECD countries guarantee 100% average payment rate for the entirety of maternity leave. These include Austria , which provides 16 fully paid weeks, Mexico, which provides 12 fully paid weeks, and Luxembourg, which provides 20 fully paid weeks. Why did maternity leave become a social right? This group’s demands for fairer labour standards in the wake of World War One included 12 weeks of paid maternity leave as “a medical necessity and social right”, a policy adopted by the International Labour Organisation in November 1919. Four-fifths of US workers don't have access to any paid parental leave (Credit: Alamy)",

The case for cash rather than paid leave can be especially compelling for low-income families, who often struggle to meet basic needs while also having the least access to paid parental leave programs through their employers, and for households with stay-at-home parents, who may not directly benefit from work-based supports. In 2024, the Convergence Collaborative on Supports for Working Families introduced a bipartisan proposal for paid parental leave consisting of a stand-alone 12-week leave policy funded at the federal level with adequate wage replacement based on a social insurance model.",

People are classified as obese when their body mass index (BMI)—a person's weight divided by the square of the person's height—is over 30 kg/m2; the range 25–30 kg/m2 is defined as overweight. The World Health Organization, the US, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Germany, the European Parliament and medical societies (such as the American Medical Association) classify obesity as a disease. Medical organizations tend to classify people living with obesity as based on body mass index (BMI) – a ratio of a person's weight in kilograms to the square \"Square (algebra)\") of their height in meters. *Obesity*. * \"Obesity 2015\". * Obesity Obesity",

However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity.",

Dec 6, 2024 · Exploring the controversial legacy of Freud ’s theories and their impact on psychology Jun 14, 2025 · Sigmund Freud , a towering figure in the history of psychology, has left an indelible mark on the field through his pioneering work in psychoanalysis. His theories, which include concepts such as the id, ego, and superego, continue to influence contemporary thought, despite the controversies and debates surrounding their scientific validity. This article seeks to explore Freud ’s legacy by ... Was Freud a scientist? Psychoanalysis is routinely dismissed because it is unscientific; however, developments in evolutionary psychology and more recently neuroscience recommend a more balanced assessment of Freud ’s legacy. During the latter half of the 20th century, Freud ’s scientific reputation sank to an unprecedented low. What did Freud say about psychology? According to Freud , ‘our civilization is built on the suppression of our drives’. 3 In the 1890s, Freud had written the posthumously published (and titled) Project for a Scientific Psychology, in which he attempted to integrate constructs that would become central to psychoanalysis and neurology. Is Freud regressive? Today, the majority of mental health practitioners, including those who are trained in psychoanalysis, view Freud's controversial theories as regressive and believe that most feminist critiques of Freud, particularly those about penis envy and female hysteria, are valid and justified. Was Freud a progressive? Though Freud and some of his theories are considered by some to be regressive today, he would have likely been considered a progressive within the milieu of the 19th-century bourgeoise, Jewish, Viennese enclave in which he developed those theories.",

Astronomers have found the clearest evidence yet that life might exist beyond the solar system, from the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years away from Earth, setting off rare excitement – tinged with caution – in the global scientific community. So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns.

Suppose we do go to Mars, he says, and find living organisms in the subsurface that are DNA based, like life on Earth. The Clipper likely wouldn't be able to find life on Europa, but it could help make the case for a follow-up lander that could dig into the surface, studying its chemistry the way rovers have studied Mars's.",

A rough correlation also exists between mating behavior in primates and sexual dimorphism—that is, differences in body mass and size between males and females of the same species. The more dimorphic a primate species is, the more likely it is that males fight over females. Many anthropologists also dispute Lovejoy's conclusion that monogamy nurtured by males providing food for their mates and offspring has been a hominin strategy for millions of years. erectus* females started to approach the physical stature of males and to have a similar degree of dimorphism as in modern humans, which together could suggest that *H.",

Here, I place human sibling proportions in mammalian perspective by comparing data from a global sample of 103 human populations (*n* = 197 658 sibling dyads in total) and compare this with a dataset of 34 non-human mammal species (*n* = 61 163 sibling dyads). Although the variation in sibling composition across the human dataset is demonstrative of the obvious fact that humans are not universally monogamous, the finding that human rates of full siblings overlap with the range seen in socially monogamous mammal species and are consistently higher than those observed in non-monogamously mating mammal species lends weight to the broad-stroke characterization of monogamy as the modal mating pattern for our species.",

Since Hollywood gets it wrong, and it’s actually very difficult to kill another human being, the general public is relatively unaware of reflex training — the training responsible for 90% of American soldiers firing at Vietnamese soldiers. There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”. The point of all this is that the nature of war requires conditioning people to fight for people they are trained to see as family.",

On the contrary, there is abundant evidence that war is a comparatively recent cultural addition to the human repertoire, acquired within the last 10,000 years or so as a result of several factors, including the invention of agriculture – resulting in the accumulation of valuable material resources that lend themselves to being stolen as well as defended, along with enabling the construction of elaborate social hierarchies – plus increasingly effective technologies for communication, coordination and killing.

McAleese talks about the historical significance of the trip – and about the allure of monarchy, which continues to fascinate people globally.

The abbreviation \"OK\" (which later turned into the globally used word \"okay\") was first noted in 1839 in the office of Charles Gordon Greene at the Boston Morning Post. In this case, however, the abbreviation \"OK\" stood for \"Old Kinderhook,\" which was the nickname of the Democratic Party candidate, Martin Van Buren, who came from Kinderhook. During the election campaign, Van Buren's supporters formed the \"OK Club,\" and this is likely when the meanings \"Old Kinderhook\" and \"Oll Korrect\" started to merge. Nowadays, \"okay\" is used globally, and it is regularly cited as the world's most widely used word. ## How Do You Say \"Okay\"? The following voices are available on your browser.

Even in jurisdictions that do not recognize surrogacy arrangements, if the potential adoptive parents and the birth mother proceed without any intervention from the government and do not change their mind along the way, they will likely be able to achieve the effects of surrogacy by having the gestational carrier give birth and then give the child up for private adoption to the intended parents.*[citation needed*]. Other human rights activists express concern over the conditions under which gestational carriers are kept by surrogacy clinics which exercise much power and control over the process of surrogate pregnancy.

By integrating smartphone use into the curriculum and establishing clear guidelines for responsible usage, schools can foster digital literacy and teach students how to navigate the online world safely and ethically. Allowing smartphones in school can exacerbate existing socioeconomic disparities, creating a digital divide between students who have access to technology and those who do not. * **Addressing Equity Issues:** Schools must address equity issues by providing loaner devices and free Wi-Fi access to students who do not have access to technology at home.

Hao Yu, associate professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School and at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, said his finding raises the question of whether the policies are being enforced. “The most surprising thing may be that school-level cellphone policy was so prevalent,” said Yu. “Almost every public school we surveyed indicated that they have a cellphone policy.”. The research, conducted in October 2024 and published in a recent JAMA Health Forum, surveyed public school principals about cellphone policies effective during the 2024-2025 school year. The survey found that 96.68 percent of public schools have some sort of cellphone policy. Among them are differences in smartphone policies by school characteristics, such as whether policies at public charter schools or private schools, for example, differ from those at traditional public schools; what associations exist between the policies and student mental health; and how schools enforce cellphone policies.",

More often than not, students in high school completion programs fulfill high school diploma requirements while on track for an associate’s degree, which is a two-year program. For example, if you wish to strengthen your English language skills in order to better succeed in university-level courses (and the admissions process), the increased support of a high school completion program may serve you well.

Bear in mind that iterating on a dictionary will return its keys, therefore the `get` method takes arguments which are the dictionary keys, which in turn returns the value that key is pointing to. TL;DR It's a simple way of saying sort the dictionary keys using the values as the sort criteria. If you want to sort based on the values instead, you need to transform the keys to their corresponding values, and of course the obvious way to do this is with `get`. If you just wanted a sorted list of values you could do `sorted(dict1.values())`, and if you wanted the keys sorted by their value (not the value they map to), you could just do `sorted(dict1)`. This means the method will compare the keys according to the value returned by the function applied to the items.",

You can make AJAX requests to applications loaded from the SAME domain and SAME port. $.ajax({ url: \"https://app.asana.com/-/api/0.1/workspaces/\", type: 'GET', dataType: 'json', // added data type success: function(res) { console.log(res); alert(res); } });. var settings = { \"async\": true, \"crossDomain\": true, \"url\": \"\", \"method\": \"GET\", \"headers\": { \"content-type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" }, \"data\": { \"username\": \"[email protected]\", \"password\": \"12345678\" } } $.ajax(settings).done(function (response) { console.log(response); });. i think the problem is that there is no data in the success-function because the request breaks up with an 401 error in your case and thus has no success. $.ajax({ url: \"https://app.asana.com/-/api/0.1/workspaces/\", type: 'GET', error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) { alert(xhr.status); alert(thrownError); } });. 0\") Problems with Ajax get Request. 2\") AJAX http GET request. 0\") Wordpress Simple AJAX Get Request.",

Marijuana legalization should prioritize public health, consumer safety, and justice for those harmed by criminalization. > “ In many states where cannabis (marijuana) is legal, large companies are putting profits ahead of health. Cannabis laws must protect consumer health and ensure that people who were devastated by criminalization benefit from legal markets.”. Ideally, marijuana should be legal at the state and federal levels as a regulated, adult-only, age-restricted consumer product. ## Most Americans support legalizing marijuana. An overwhelming 88 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational use. Lawmakers must refocus marijuana legalization on public health and equity, ensuring those most harmed by criminalization benefit from reforms. ### **Despite state-level legalization, marijuana remains criminalized federally.**. ### **Legalizing marijuana right prioritizes health and community investment, not corporate greed.**.

In states where marijuana used is fully or partially legal, the new cannabis industry can impact the local economy in a variety of ways. Washington and Colorado are the two states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational use the longest. The more states that legalize cannabis, the lower the cost of enforcement would likely be; if marijuana were to be legalized on a national level, these costs would likely drop considerably. ## How Many States Have Legalized Marijuana? In 2023, the states that legalized marijuana for personal consumption generated $4.2 billion in annual tax revenue.3 This revenue does not include city revenue or proceeds distributed to smaller municipalities.

The underlying economic and regulatory forces are certainly different; the NFL enforces a strict salary cap designed to keep competition fair, while soccer operates within a free global market with minimal spending limits. Ultimately, as wage inflation in both the NFL and global soccer continues to disproportionately funnel wealth towards elite athletes, teams are likely to become more financially vulnerable while fair competition will erode. As these superstar quarterbacks are marketed to consumers as the focal point of each game, other players at non-premium positions (running back, linebacker) lose opportunities to earn new contracts as teams structure their budget around their more marketable star quarterback. These oil-state takeovers simply bully smaller teams into losing their best players, ruining the fairness and competitiveness of the game.",

From a football perspective, he gave us trophies, amazing players, and beautiful attacking football, the likes of which the Premier League had never quite seen. Wenger shepherded us through more than a decade of relative austerity, in which he maintained fiscal prudence as we paid for the stadium, worked with what little money was available to him and ensured Champions League football, year over year.

After a 2-page summary of Wenger’s statistics as a player (1969-1981), we get the league records and standings for each team Wenger managed, from his first season at Nancy (1984) to his last at Arsenal (2018), a summary of his accomplishments at Arsenal, a list of every player who appeared for Arsenal during Wenger’s tenure, and a list of the top ten transfer fees paid by Arsenal during his time. In some ways, *Wenger: My Life and Lessons in Red and White*is written particularly with Arsenal fans in mind, assuming they can fill in gaps in the narrative from memory while Wenger tries to mollify their disappointment at the club maintaining a top-four level without ever claiming a league championship during his last fourteen years managing Arsenal FC.",

There is such a worry about once amateur athletes get paid, the hype of college sports will be destroyed.

The primary financial compensation student athletes receive is a scholarship that pays all or part of their tuition and other college-related expenses. Division III sports programs do not award sports scholarships, although other forms of financial aid are available to student athletes at these schools. The NCAA imposes strict rules for recruiting student athletes and provides a guide to help students determine their eligibility to play college sports. Once a student has received a scholarship offer from a college or university, the person may sign a national letter of intent (NLI), which is a voluntary, legally binding contract between an athlete and the school committing the student to enroll and play the designated sport for that school only.",

As Jon Solomon, Editorial Director for the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute explained, “The most glaring example occurred when the University of North Carolina was found by outside parties to have organized fake classes that enabled dozens of athletes to gain and maintain their eligibility… of the 3,100 students who took the fake classes over 18 years, 47.4 percent were athletes… North Carolina avoided NCAA penalties by essentially arguing that the NCAA should stay out of irregularities in college courses.” The NCAA polices athletes’ finances but does not ensure a quality education.

According to Heathcote, who passed away in August 2017 at age ninety, the members of the press in the days leading up, and immediately after the game, were utterly “relentless” in pursuing the story of “the Magic man and the Bird man,” as if the NCAA final were a game of one-on-one.",

I think a better answer is: Use MagicMock if you know what you're doing, otherwise use Mock. That doesn't answer my question - why bother with plain Mock if MagicMock does exactly the same plus much more? If you are changing magic methods, then you cannot use `MagicMock`, because it is mocking the magic methods you are trying to test. Secondly, MagicMock provides default implementations of many/most magic methods, whereas Mock doesn't.

An overarching dependency of \"magic\" is how the lone basic value (e.g. number) has no commonly known semantic (like Pi), but has a locally known semantic (e.g. your program), which is not entirely clear from context or could be abused in good or bad context(s). Here \"2\" is a \"magic\" number, which is factored out to a symbolic constant `default_padding` within the context of the GUI UX of \"my program\" in order to make it use as `default_padding` quickly understood in the greater context of the enclosing code. Thus, any basic value, whose meaning (semantic and purpose) cannot be sufficiently and quickly understood is a good candidate for a symbolic constant in the place of the basic value (e.g. magic number).",

That came the following year, when heavyweight champion Sonny Liston agreed to fight Ali. The challenger geared up for the bout with a litany of insults and rhymes, including the line, \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.\" He beat the fearsome Liston in a sixth-round technical knockout before a stunned Miami Beach crowd.

Although football-type games have been around for centuries, the sport we know today is often said to have begun in 1863, when England’s newly formed Football Association wrote down a set of rules. However, “soccer” never became much more than a nickname in Great Britain.** By the 20th century, rugby football was more commonly called rugby, while association football had earned the right to be known as just plain football. Meanwhile, in the United States, a sport emerged in the late 19th century that borrowed elements of both rugby and association football. As a result, **American association-football players increasingly adopted *soccer* to refer to their sport.** The United States Football Association, which had formed in the 1910s as the official organizing body of American soccer, changed its name to the United States Soccer Football Association in 1945, and it later dispensed with the “Football” altogether.",

Red Bull team principal and Ford chief executive officer Jim Farley at the Italian Grand Prix in September. Red Bull will begin an engine partnership deal with US car giant Ford, which is part-funding the power-units Red Bull are designing for the new regulations.

It’s all change for 2026 as we welcome slightly smaller, lighter cars, active aerodynamics and greater electrical energy, which should make for a very different racing product. At the moment, the only driver who can change his number — and will — is Norris, who has decided to take number 1 next year. It’s a number reserved for the reigning world champion, something Verstappen has held onto for four consecutive years. Verstappen’s race number under the current rules is 33.",

For Barbara Reynolds, former civil rights activist, “activists in the 1960s confronted white mobs and police with dignity and decorum… But at protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot.”10 From Protests to Ethno-Racial Coalitions Turning to the question of its impact, BLM protests have helped frame American politics.",

Columbus, basing his calculations on Toscanelli's map, & Marco Polo's work, estimated the distance from the Canary Islands to Cathay at around 2,300 miles. **Second Voyage - 1493-1496 CE**: Columbus arrived back in the New World as governor of the lands he had claimed with a fleet of 17 ships full of colonists to establish communities for Spain as well as a number of dogs to be used in subduing the natives.",

Following a series of increasingly national roles – as well as a series of setbacks – Clinton campaigned for president in 1992. In the general election, Clinton competed against the sitting president, Republican George H.W. Bush. Early in his first term, Clinton sought an additional reform he believed would help voters’ financial concerns: affordable health insurance for all Americans. Clinton wanted to find a way for the U.S. government to support Americans’ health-related expenses. During most of his time as president, Clinton had been under investigation. In time, Hillary Clinton became the U.S. senator from New York, as well as a secretary of state and the Democratic Party’s candidate for president.

The committee is seeking all of the department's documents and communications on Epstein and Maxwell \"relating or referring to human trafficking, exploitation of minors, sexual abuse, or related activity\", as well as files from the US criminal cases against Maxwell and Epstein, documents from a 2007 agreement to not prosecute Epstein and federal investigations into the former financier. As demands grew for the Trump administration to release more Epstein records, the justice department recently met Maxwell.",

The editorial board of The New York Times stated, “He may have committed a crime…but he has done his country a great service.” In an Op-ed in the same newspaper, Ed Morrissey argued that Snowden was not a hero, but a criminal: “by leaking information about the behavior rather than reporting it through legal channels, Snowden chose to break the law.” According to Morrissey, Snowden should be prosecuted for his actions, arguing that his actions broke a law “intended to keep legitimate national-security data and assets safe from our enemies; it is intended to keep Americans safe.”. What harm did Snowden cause? 2. Do you agree that Snowden’s actions were ethically justified even if legally prohibited?",

Where did 'political correctness' come from? Conservative author Dinesh D’Souza states: The term 'political correctness' seems to have originated in the early part of this century, when it was employed by various species of Marxists to describe and enforce conformity to preferred ideological positions.

The United States is the one country today whose global superpower status is undisputed. According to Tufts University political scientist Michael Beckley, long-term economic growth depends upon a country’s geography, demography (people), and political institutions, and the United States is better positioned than competing powers in all three categories, being “big (geographically), young, and highly educated” with a healthier government than competing superpowers. Some experts argue that China will pass the United States as a global superpower in the coming decades.

Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Wednesday that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has $90m less than it needs this year. “Our resources have been slashed, along with funding for human rights organisations, including at the grassroots level, around the world,” Turk said. The warning from Turk comes as the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which handles humanitarian aid and crisis response, launches a $23bn appeal for 2026 while also facing cuts of its own, acknowledging that a sharp drop in donor support means tens of millions of people in urgent need will be left without assistance. “All this has extensive ripple effects on international and national efforts to protect human rights,” Turk said.",

The initial Arab Spring was “like one giant Woodstock,” said Alaoui. “People might think that the region is stagnant, that we’ve simply gone back to the bad old days of Hosni Mubarak or other Arab autocrats who were exemplars of ossification and stagnation, but that masks a lot of change in the region currently happening,” said Tarek Masoud, Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy and the Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman Professor of International Relations. “The drivers of the change are not the photogenic, admirable, creative young people who brought us the Arab Spring,” he said. “My belief is that the Saudi government looked at these uprisings of young people across the region and said, ‘If we don’t change things, we are going to find that happening here, and we’re not going to be able to weather it,’” said Masoud.",

In a recent survey in 10 Arab nations (Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian Territories),1 we measured public attitudes toward the Arab Spring protests, its goals, and its beneficiaries. In our survey, respondents were asked to rank the goals of the Arab Spring protests from a list that includes increasing political freedoms, reducing corruption, enhancing dignity, improving the economic situation, and promoting social justice, among others. On average, fewer than 20 percent of respondents agreed that the goals of economic improvement and social justice were reached, despite ranking these as the top two goals of the Arab Spring protests. Survey respondents’ views on how various ethno-religious groups benefited from or were harmed by the Arab Spring process reveal notable signs of the way these groups are perceived by the society at large (Figure 8).",

On all the major social issues-abortion, quotas, gay rights, feminism, crime and punishment, the family, moral and religious values-the Reagan administration has been conservative and correct, even if reasonable people might quarrel over details of policy and political strategy. All told, in my judgment as a conservative Democrat, President Reagan will be remembered more for the opportunities that slipped from his grasp than for achievements that reshaped the American political landscape.

In a case about the constitutionality of a tariff on goods trafficked between the island and the mainland, the U.S. Supreme Court defined Puerto Rico in 1901 as “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense” because it was neither a state of the American union nor an independent republic.

America’s mainstream media is presenting this document as the latest example of Trump’s hostility to Europe, and many European elites feel the same way. But the question is, *What kind of result do we look for?* And this is, I think, the most interesting question in this situation, because we have been trying to change the direction of the European Union for decades, since the 1990s. So, maybe Europe needs a shock from our good old friend America to start a true debate, because there was no debate in the European mainstream. And of course, you need power in at least one big European country to change the situation, France or Germany. It may not be so obvious from an American perspective, but Europe is very divided, and even the European conservative movement is very divided.",

          "content": "According to a new book co-authored by Monica Duffy Toft, professor of international politics, the U.S. is indeed engaging in military interventions more often than before, and for different reasons. “The rate of interventions has accelerated over time, and since the end of the Cold War, we’ve been pursuing fewer and lower national interests,” says Toft, director of the Center for Strategic Studies and academic dean at The Fletcher School. Toft calls this the rise of kinetic diplomacy, “the use of force first over other tools of state.” She says, “Traditionally, you think of diplomacy first and use of force as last. Pointing to U.S. involvements in Vietnam and Afghanistan, neither of which ended in victory, she says, “It's much more difficult today.” That’s another argument for reconsidering the increased reliance on military intervention. Toft likens the current state of U.S. foreign policy to a game of whack-a-mole, in which the U.S. sees issues popping up and has “only one way of dealing with them, which is the hammer” of military force.",

U.S. Army soldiers assigned to the 10th Mountain Division stand security at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul, Afghanistan, August 15, 2021. It is these unsuccessful post–Cold War interventions that have engendered serious doubts among policymakers and the public about the role of force in U.S. foreign policy. Even so, U.S. decisionmaking still has a strong bias in favor of military intervention. When crises emerge, the pressure for a U.S. military response is often immediate, on the grounds that it is better to try to control the situation than to do nothing. To explore how often U.S. military interventions have advanced U.S. objectives, we built a database of conflicts and crises that involved U.S. interests between 1946 and 2018. ### The Past, Present, and Future of U.S. Ground Interventions: Identifying Trends, Characteristics, and Signposts. ### Characteristics of Successful U.S. Military Interventions. ### Assessing Trade-Offs in U.S. Military Intervention Decisions: Whether, When, and with What Size Force to Intervene.",

In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.24 In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest).",

To outsiders, the past five years have called into question whether China remains insecure, as it insists, or is actually bent on global hegemony, which would be more consistent with its accelerated military spending and its provocative deployments in the South China Sea. Similarly, a common reading of recent increased U.S. military spending, along with its accelerated deployment of armed forces abroad, is that the United States is an aggressive power, committed to maintaining the post–Cold War status quo.",

In Sudan, if the war-related famine again becomes severe, dividing the country into an Arab north and a Christian south may save the vast majority of threatened Sudanese lives at the lowest cost in dollars—and in the blood of intervening troops. But muscular interventions in wars like those in Angola and Congo will probably not happen until more countries develop the military capabilities for such operations—which brings us to the final question. Although the United States need not create a specialized armed force for peace operations, it should modify its military force structure to lessen the strain of various types of limited missions around the world. Even if such countries cannot be expected to lead forcible interventions, they can provide valuable combat forces that enable peacekeeping missions to uphold ceasefires and peace accords under challenge.",

In any such situation, both sides can point to internationally agreed principles approved by UN member states, and argue from irrevocably opposed concepts of sovereignty: does it convey complete protection for any regime, or can it be challenged by the international community in the name of RtoP?

But in the town of Gori, where he was born, the city council recently decided to re-erect a huge statue of Stalin, which the pro-Western government of President Mikheil Saakashvili took down almost three years ago. But Olga Tochishvili, who has worked as a guide here since the Soviet era, says attitudes towards Stalin are changing. \"In Georgia, most of the old generation like Stalin. A few weeks ago the city council allocated funds to re-erect the statue at the Stalin museum. Gori's new mayor, David Razuadze, from Georgian Dream says Stalin's statue will be re-installed by the summer. \"People in Gori have this feeling that the name Stalin is known in the world and so is their little town… Georgia is known worldwide because of Stalin.

When President Obama left office on January 20, 2017, his impact and legacy were unclear. With Republicans in control of both the presidency and the Congress in 2017, however, some of Obama’s most notable achievements—the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate change agreement, and Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals—were overturned or under attack. Obama’s lasting impact on American life may turn out to have been greatest in terms of the crises that did not happen. In a C-SPAN survey of 91 historians, political scientists, and other presidential scholars, Obama was ranked 12th among all presidents since George Washington for the overall quality of his performance as chief executive. Bush, who ranked 33rd, Bill Clinton (15th), and George H.W. Bush (20th), but not the president whose trajectory-changing legacy Obama once said he wanted to emulate: Ronald Reagan, who ranked 8th. ###### Barack Obama Presidency Page. ###### Life Before the Presidency.",

And from then on, the Obama presidency struggled under a radicalized Republican Party. Coleman notes, “In the summer of 2012, under pressure from party activists to show some effort on immigration reform before the November election and unable to rise above the partisanship that dominated Washington as he had hoped, President Obama turned to his executive powers and announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.” But again we see the weakness of executive action.",

That America's first black president will be followed by the untitled leader of the Birther movement, a candidate slow to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and happy to receive the backing of white nationalists, Donald Trump can easily be portrayed as a personal repudiation and also proof of racial regression.

The First Amendment, like the rest of the Bill of Rights, originally restricted only what the federal government may do and did not bind the states. In 1868, however, the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution, and it prohibited states from denying people “liberty” without “due process.” Since then the U.S. Supreme Court has gradually used the due process clause to apply most of the Bill of Rights to state governments. Thus, the First Amendment now covers actions by federal, state, and local governments. The First Amendment, however, applies only to restrictions imposed by the government, since the First and Fourteenth amendments refer only to government action.",

Throughout history, protests have played a crucial role in advocating for change, with notable examples like the Boston Tea Party, the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi, and the March on Washington for civil rights. ## Protest. No matter what the intent, protest can take on many potential forms, often ranging from individual demonstrations to mass gatherings of people who assemble in support of a particular cause. Between March and April 1930, Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi carried out the Salt March, an influential act of nonviolent civil disobedience in protest of British rule in India. The three major forms of protest are civil disobedience, nonviolent protest, and violent protest. Acts of civil disobedience may be carried out by individuals or whole groups of protesters. Such protests often come in the form of demonstrations, marches, and vigils. When peaceful demonstrations fail to make an impact, violent protests sometimes become inevitable.",

This implies that concessions by elites to protester demands will be more likely during peak cycles of protest.”  The author analyzed whether protest is systematically related to two types of concessions: establishing a CRB and lowering fatalities of minorities. The author ultimately found that protests influence cities to establish more powerful citizen oversight boards and that they lower fatalities in minority communities. The American Sociological Association, founded in 1905, is a nonprofit membership association dedicated to serving sociologists in their work, advancing sociology as a science and profession, and promoting the contributions to and use of sociology by society.",

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful.",

The increasing adoption of drones has allowed non-state groups to engage more effectively with larger, more powerful states. While the use of drones by both state and non-state actors has risen, non-state actors have a much greater increase in adoption. Between 2018 and 2023, the number of states using drones rose from 16 to 40, a 150 per cent increase. However, over the same period the number of non-state groups who committed at least one drone attack rose from six to 91, an increase of over 1,400 per cent. As general drone use in conflict has risen, the number of drone strikes and fatalities has similarly increased. The most striking example of the use of drones by a state actor in the last year occurred in the conflict in Ukraine.",

In a recent study, we show that such approval is associated with higher public support and perceived legitimacy for a strike, which is cross-nationally consistent in France and the U.S. Variation in the use and constraint of drones suggests four patterns of strikes that are emerging globally. Fourth, countries can use drones *tactically* with *multilateral* constraint, adopting what we call juridical strikes. The treatment groups varied a fictional country’s drone strike in terms of use (tactical or strategic), constraint (unilateral or multilateral), and civilian casualty (yes or no). Sensitivity to civilian casualties also constitutes nearly 7.5% of French respondents’ perceptions for legitimate drone strikes. These findings have implications for French and U.S. strikes while also providing insights for countries’ evolving use of drones.",

President Trump also rolled back Obama’s restrictions on drone strike targets and protections against civilian deaths, further expanding the capacity of the drone program. This can be attributed to how Obama issued the Presidential Policy Guidance, which tightened procedures for use of drone strikes including standards that targets must be “a continuing, imminent threat to Americans” and a “near certainty” that there would be no civilian casualties in 2013.",

On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: \"Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems.\" Despite this, Greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, \"History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums\" as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.",

As chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (1974–77) during Gerald Ford’s presidency, Greenspan promoted policies that caused the rate of inflation to drop from 11 to 6.5 percent. In 2011 the bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission found that Greenspan’s failure to curtail trade in securities backed by subprime mortgage loans (*see also* mortgage-backed security) during the U.S. housing bubble of the early 2000s and his advocacy of deregulation of the financial industry had contributed to the global financial crisis of 2007-08 (*see* Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008).",

Working from home had a strong positive effect on women's mental health, but only in certain circumstances. Light or occasional working from home had no clear effect on women's mental health. Workers with poorer mental health are the most sensitive to long commutes and the most likely to benefit from substantial working from home arrangements.

So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism?

Along with the dissociation and multiple or split personalities, people with dissociative disorders may have a number of other psychiatric problems, including symptoms like:.

Investing in real estate may seem like a smart financial move, but it may be even smarter to compare it to investing in stocks before making any big decisions. The main difference between investing in real estate and investing in stocks is that real estate involves buying properties and renting them out or investing in REITs (real estate investment trusts), whereas investing in stocks involves buying a small slice of a company and waiting for those shares to increase in value. It’s also important to know that you can purchase shares in real estate investments without the headaches of actually buying, managing and selling properties. There are lots of metrics you can look at when figuring out if investing in real estate or stocks will make you more money. * Real estate investments can be more work than stocks.

While real estate and gold are two assets that can appreciate in value over time, the stock market will generally grow at a much higher rate, experts say. McClanahan also points out that unlike gold and real estate, stocks are diversified assets, meaning you're spreading out your cash versus concentrating it into one investment. If you are among the Americans that want exposure to real estate or gold, there are different ways to do it wisely, experts say.

Like its American peers, the global real estate market in industrialized nations offers comparable returns to the international stock market. Over the long term, returns on stocks in industrialized nations is 7%, including dividends, and 7.2% in global real estate, including rental income some investors receive from properties. Real estate promises to appreciate over the long term, offers an opportunity to collect rent for income, and allows investors to leverage borrowed capital to increase additional returns on investment.",

For example, consider the growth from 1970 to now; then, the average price of a home was $27,000.2 That same investment property today would fetch at least $500,000 based on the average housing-inflation rate since 1970—and possibly much more in some hotter-than-average real-estate markets.2 To put this into perspective, if a 25-year-old had made this investment in 1970, this now 55-year-old investment could potentially contribute to a relatively generous retirement nest egg if the property were sold. They provide exposure to real estate without the hassle of property upkeep and offer liquidity similar to stocks, allowing investors to quickly exit their investments if necessary.",

Just as it sounds, an investment property is “any real estate property purchased with the intention of earning a return on the investment either through rental income, the future resale of the property, or both.” Rental properties are the most common investment option, as they can reliably generate steady income and allow you to retain ownership of the property, accruing more wealth as the property appreciates in value. Also known as the cap rate, this is the rate of return that is expected to be generated on a real estate investment property. Return on investment (ROI) is the expected profits from a rental property, as a percentage. In real estate, this means that a property is only a good investment if it will generate at least 2% of the property’s purchase price each month in cash flow.",

When it comes to hardware, there isn’t that much difference between the best iPhones and the best Android phones. Because Apple controls both the software and hardware for its phones, it’s able to add features in iOS that work across its devices — not just iPhones, but Macs, Apple Watches and iPads as well. iPhone apps tend to cost more than their Android counterparts, with many of the best iPhone games locked behind the Apple Arcade paywall. While Google features are fairly polished, the same can’t be said of devices like the Motorola Edge 50 Pro. And given the irregular update schedule for Android devices, new AI features won’t appear with the regularity you’ll get with an iPhone. For years, Apple had a big performance edge over Android devices, with iPhones typically posting much better Geekbench scores.",

Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Composite: History Hit. After three years of further development, Sony launches the first PlayStation – now all one word – in Japan, the Nintendo relationship long over. Image Credit: Alamy / History Hit. Microsoft boss Bill Gates assembles a four-man console-manufacturing dream team, nervous that the upcoming PlayStation 2 is likely to eat into the company’s home-computer user base with its rumoured abilities to play CDs and DVDs. Sure enough, PS2 launches in Japan in March 2000 and by year’s end has shifted 6.4 million copies worldwide, with the help of essential sports sim Madden NFL 2001, cult-hit snowboarder SSX, and four-player fighter Tekken Tag Tournament. Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Sony’s PS5 go on sale within one day of each other, and both consoles score praiseworthy reviews for their uncannily lifelike visuals and lightning processor speeds.",

For as long as video game consoles have existed, there has been some sort of conflict between owners of rival systems across Atari, Nintendo, SEGA and for the last twenty years or so, Xbox, PlayStation and…still Nintendo. Previously, even if Microsoft was downplaying console sales, there was *at least* this narrative that they had scooped up all these studios to finally make attractive games to compete with Sony’s first party offerings. Sony did have a brilliant bit of success with the Helldivers 2 launch, but they cancelled Naughty Dog’s Last of Us multiplayer game which cost their prized studio years of work, and now Concord, which reportedly has been in development for eight years, is about to unavoidably tank when it’s released tomorrow. But Microsoft and Sony especially are both running into significant problems with their respective models, and even if PlayStation has outsold Xbox consoles for a decade now, it’s a bit more complicated than that.",

The gap between the two consoles is widening, too; stats suggest that for every one Xbox Series X/S bought during November 2024, five PlayStation 5 consoles were also purchased (a ratio no doubt helped by the launch of the PS5 Pro.) Sony’s Game and Network Services also saw a healthy 12.3% bump in its profits during the final months of 2024, helped specifically by healthy first-party sales including Astro Bot selling 1.5 million copies in under two months, and lifetime sales for Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut surpassing 13 million.",

If the Fed does cut today, Sweet wrote, “we’ll remove the March cut in the January baseline because the central bank will want time to gauge how past cuts are impacting the economy.”.

An internet troll is someone who intentionally and aggressively harasses people online with disruptive, offensive, or inflammatory comments. According to Miller, trolls can often exhibit deeper, darker traits linked to antisocial behavior, aggression, and cyberbullying. The same behaviors that fuel cyberbullies—hate speech, doxxing, misinformation—are frequently present in internet trolls and are linked to specific personality traits. “Constructs like psychopathy and narcissism and even sadism are pretty regularly linked to online trolling behaviors,” Miller says. The ability to hide behind a pseudonym and encrypted networks gives internet trolls the security they need to act out against real people, from bullying your neighbors to insulting or even threatening celebrities and politicians. It’s harder for an internet troll to act out this behavior in the real world, where jailtime or a simple punch in the face might be the consequences. “However, research suggests that those who consistently troll others online are often difficult people offline, too.",

Effect sizes were comparable to the effect of social interactions on well-being. Does Twitter affect health? We also found that specific Twitter behaviors were linked to different outcomes: scrolling down the feed or using Twitter to distract oneself from problems (passive uses) were linked to within-person decreases in well-being , consistent with the idea that passively using social media is more detrimental to people 41, 58. Why do people use Twitter so much? The study states that “people who used Twitter a lot were lonelier and more bored; people who retweeted a lot were more polarised; people who used Twitter to avoid their problems (escapism) had lower wellbeing and higher outrage levels; and people who used Twitter for social interactions had a higher sense of belonging”.

The United States is the one country today whose global superpower status is undisputed. According to Tufts University political scientist Michael Beckley, long-term economic growth depends upon a country’s geography, demography (people), and political institutions, and the United States is better positioned than competing powers in all three categories, being “big (geographically), young, and highly educated” with a healthier government than competing superpowers. Some experts argue that China will pass the United States as a global superpower in the coming decades. Others argue that Russia is not even a potential superpower because it has the trade relations of a Third World country, a much smaller GDP than China or the United States, and no highly rated universities, among other things.",

Mr. Douthat is an Opinion columnist and the host of the “Interesting Times” podcast. I tend to be pretty skeptical of this scenario: America has outlasted challengers before and China seems to me to have remarkable strengths, yes, but also serious weaknesses. Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

The UK has become the \"most expensive place in the world\" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises \"overly complex\" bureaucracy around the sector. It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. The UK is also setting up small nuclear power stations, which are faster to build than full-size reactors. The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were \"essential to the UK's future\", with the country at risk of missing out on a \"worldwide nuclear renaissance\". ## How does nuclear power work and why is the UK investing in it? Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations have \"made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear\".",

Jul 5, 2025 · The question of whether to \"be first into the market \" ( first -mover advantage) or \"be better \" (fast-follower advantage) is a classic strategic dilemma with valid arguments for both sides. Oct 2, 2025 · But being first also has significant risks. To answer the question of whether you should be first to market , start with whether you have the stomach for that level of risk. Feb 26, 2025 · Why first movers often fail while second movers win big. Discover the hidden truths behind startup success and the key traits of great CEOs. Why is a first to market a good idea? The reason this theory works in some cases is that the first to market can capture a disproportionate amount of the customer base early on , influencing user behavior and becoming synonymous with the product itself. Uber didn’t just launch a ridesharing service; it became the name that defined the entire industry. Why should a company be first? The answer depends on a number of factors: the nature of the product, the competitive landscape, the company's resources, and the overall market readiness. In some cases, being first can give a company a crucial lead, allowing it to establish itself as the dominant player before competitors can catch up. When did the first mover & late follower enter the market? In the first study, the first mover entered the market in 2015 , while the second emerged a year later. In the second study, the late follower entered the market in 2019, after the first mover had gone through growing pains associated with care quality and data security. Is rushing to market a good idea? The key lesson here is that rushing to market may win the initial headlines, but it ’s the long-term quality of the product that dictates lasting success. When companies prioritize speed over substance, they risk alienating customers who expect reliability, usability, and consistency. When Should You Be First ? When Should You Be Best?

          "content": "This brings us to one of the most debated strategies in the world of product development: should a company strive to be the first to market or take its time and release the best possible version? Lyft’s slower, more deliberate approach won it favor among certain customer segments, and while it may not have overtaken Uber in market share, it established itself as a credible and quality-driven alternative. What Lyft demonstrated is that while Uber captured market share, being first didn’t insulate Uber from problems caused by that breakneck speed. This philosophy has helped make Apple the most valuable company in the world, consistently delivering high-quality, refined products that resonate deeply with consumers. The key lesson here is that rushing to market may win the initial headlines, but it’s the long-term quality of the product that dictates lasting success. Companies that rush to market may win the initial race, but in the marathon of business success, it’s often the company that delivers the best product that ultimately prevails.",

The retailer announced on Tuesday the test of a new Amazon Shopping feature that will redirect shoppers to other brands’ websites if they search in the app for a particular product that Amazon doesn’t carry. The retailer says the feature is only a beta test for now and will be activated for a subset of U.S. customers who perform searches in the Amazon Shopping app. However, Amazon tells TechCrunch that the experience *won’t* only include brands offering Buy with Prime. “We’re continuously working to expand selection and make shopping even more convenient for customers,” noted Rajiv Mehta, Amazon’s VP of search and conversational shopping, in an announcement about the new feature. “We’re testing bringing more selection and brands into our search results to help customers find even more of what they want and further improve our shopping experience for customers.”.",

A wealth tax would require taxpayers to pay at regular intervals on the appreciation of their assets, regardless of whether they have the cash or liquid assets to pay. Under her plan, high-wealth taxpayers would likely pay taxes on their capital gains each year as their assets appreciate in value. Even a very wealthy individual may not have the liquid assets to pay the tax on their changes in wealth. Under Harris’s proposal, taxpayers who don’t have cash to pay taxes may  have to borrow money or sell. *Nathan Goldman and Christina Lewellen are associate professors of accounting in the Poole College of Management.*",

According to Petersen, the airline “still offers an outstanding economy experience, though it provides slightly less space per passenger compared to Korean Air.”. “Compared to other major carriers like the big three American airlines, Virgin offers fewer amenities,” says Petersen. “To be considered a best airline you have to be a seven star safety rated airline, and none of the airlines considered this year have changed their rating from last year,” says Petersen.",

For the second year in a row, the title of safest airline in the world has been awarded to Air New Zealand. Airline Ratings’ report also analyzes the safety credentials of low-cost carriers around the world, an aviation category which gets its own annual list. This year, five budget carriers from the US were included in the top 25 safest low-cost carriers: Frontier (number 5), Southwest (9), Sun Country (15), JetBlue (17), and Allegiant Air (21), which made the list again after being cut in 2024.

So, the open office plan isn’t necessarily dead; it’s undergoing changes. So, are more companies introducing the open-plan office because of its “benefits” and objectives or simply just its trendiness? Soon enough, we’ll see a drastic shift from the unproductive, inefficient open floor plan to the versatile, adaptable flexible office space.
