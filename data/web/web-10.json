With my due respect to seinfeld NOTHING could be compared to FRIENDS. I Have been watching friends on Daily basis since 2014 , never skipped a day ,, it’s my bed time story ,, I know exactly what the next sentence is and it still cracks me up. Do you expect anyone to vote for Seinfeld on a Friend's page? I like both but I rewatch Friends more. Friends is more dear to me;can watch a lot over n over.

As early as the ’90s, reality TV was confronting third-rail issues like racism, LGBTQ rights, abortion, homelessness, and AIDS—and that was just in the first three seasons of *The Real World*. Lindemann notes in her recent book *True Story: What Reality TV Says About Us*: “for all of its extreme personalities and outlandish premises, reality TV reflects *how regressive we truly are*.” With that in mind, our list of reality TV’s most influential seasons is not a celebration of every show, or of the genre writ large. Pozner notes In her influential 2010 book *Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV*, reality programming “has the power to influence our notions of normalcy versus difference, convince us that certain behaviors are ‘innate’ for different groups of people, and present culturally constructed norms of gender, race, class, and sexuality as ‘natural,’” rather than as a reaction to external circumstances.

I’m surprised it did as well as it did, because “Gladiator II” had more than the usual number of problems: 1) The protagonist of the original film was dead, so the movie needed a new leading man; 2) The premise, without going into detail, was absurd; and, most importantly, 3) Paul Mescal didn’t seem like a tough guy. **Hello, Mick:** I have recently watched two productions of “Cape Fear.”  The first starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the second starring Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro. **Hello, Warren:**Mitchum was great in the original “Cape Fear” (1962), but Martin Scorsese’s 1991 remake starring Robert De Niro is the better movie. 3) Often, the more companies involved, the better the movie.",

The structures and requirements at poetry slams have shaped a certain style of poetry which tends to be successful within the slam context; it is work in this style which is generally termed ‘slam poetry.’ For instance, the requirement that poems performed at slams must be under three minutes has led to the creation of a style which values poems of this length.",

But the problem is that once you start to build an audience based on outrage and anger, as MSNBC and CNN are both doing in the age of Trump, you risk tumbling down a slippery slope, which is exactly what happened to Fox News. It’s alarming because in many ways Fox and MSNBC have walked right into Trump’s trap when he says the press is “the enemy of the people.” They’ve built up their audiences based on anger or support for Trump, and now they’re attached to it.",

This helps schools benchmark their students' educational outcomes against a broad sample used during the standardization process. 5. With a consistent measure of student achievement, standardized exams allow for meaningful district comparisons and help maintain educational standards nationwide. Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge.",

Thomson maintains that whether a woman has a moral obligation to allow a fetus to remain in her body is a separate question from whether the fetus is a person with a right to life, and depends instead on the amount of sacrifice or burden it imposes on her. Instead of “repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*“, the Court could simply have rejected viability as the point at which the state’s interest in protecting potential life outweighed the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, and upheld Mississippi’s right to ban abortions after 15 weeks.",

High levels of stress leading to poorer sleep, and increased demands at work or school, can also exacerbate or cause ADHD-like symptoms. Clinicians diagnose ADHD based on symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. To make an ADHD diagnosis in children, six or more symptoms in at least one of these three categories must be present. In clinical practice, the diagnostic rules allow a patient to be diagnosed with ADHD if they have most of the symptoms that cause distress, impairment or both, even when they don’t meet the full criteria.

Following changes that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, patients and clinicians might be asking more questions as a result.

The third wave of the body positivity movement arose around 2012 largely as a response to the increase in social media culture and advertisements. The body positivity movement aims to change societal and individual perceptions of weight, size, and appearance to be more accepting of all bodies regardless of their diverse characteristics.

Maria Montessori began developing her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in pedagogy at the University of Rome and learning educational theory.: 60 While visiting Rome's mental asylums during her schooling with a teacher, Montessori observed that confined children were in need of more stimulation from their environment. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12. Montessori education involves free activity within a \"prepared environment\", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child. Montessori education for this level is less developed than programs for younger children. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lillard, Angeline S (2013), \"Playful Learning and Montessori Education\" (PDF), *American Journal of Play*, vol.

Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

If you regularly spend time away from the baby, use a breast pump during your absence at the same frequency the baby would feed to maintain your milk supply. Breastfeeding has multiple benefits for you and your baby. Supplementing with formula will cause your baby to nurse less and further reduce your milk supply. After breastfeeding is established, you can allow family members to bottle-feed the baby expressed milk. If breastfeeding is not the best choice for you and your baby, iron-fortified commercially available formula is the next best option. Formula feeding is convenient and offers greater flexibility than breastfeeding.

The most succinct description of this phenomenon and the importance of experiencing infections in the first few years of life can be found in the subtitle of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine: “Please, Sneeze on My Child.” Some people fear that because vaccines prevent natural infections, the maturation of Th1 cells might be affected, thus causing children to develop allergies or asthma (this is often referred to as the “hygiene hypothesis”).

Interestingly, the *why* of Ayahuasca use seemed to play a role in the kind and severity of mental health side effects: People whose cultural or spiritual practices involved Ayahuasca use had notably fewer negative experiences than people who used it in an uncontrolled or recreational context. That risk is higher for people using Ayahuasca in concert with other substances and for individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, psychosis, mania and related mental health symptoms.

That is, I can vaguely remember various examples of people who after a particular uncomfortable or scary experience with either Ayahuasca or San Pedro decided to focus on only the other medicine of the two for the rest of their retreat.

A small 2018 study involving 20 participants found that consuming Ayahuasca once weekly for 4 weeks was as effective as an 8-week mindfulness program at increasing acceptance, a component of mindfulness that plays a fundamental role in psychological health. Several older studies have focused on the effects of Ayahuasca on substance use disorders. While taking part in an Ayahuasca ceremony may seem alluring, consuming this psychedelic brew can lead to serious, even life threatening, side effects. Aside from these dangers, participating in an Ayahuasca ceremony means putting your life in the shaman’s hands, as they’re in charge of the ingredients added to the brew, as well as determining proper dosing and monitoring you for potentially life threatening side effects.",

A 1995 study of Michigan oncologists revealed five factors that were important to physicians when considering the approval or disapproval of PAS: global attitudes toward PAS (including ideas like “Does a patient have a right to end his or her life if he or she has an incurable disease,” and “Oncologists should have the right to help a patient commit suicide by medical means”), attitudes toward the acceptability of withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining therapies, philosophical prohibitions toward PAS, concerns of legal consequences of PAS, and beliefs that PAS could be avoided with better end-of-life care [12]. When asked about current practices of PAS in states where it is legal, only 24% of physicians disagreed (49% agree; 26% neutral) that the most common reason for patients seeking PAS is physical pain (Table 4).",

Homework is a powerful tool to help narrow these inequities, giving children from all backgrounds the opportunity to keep learning when they are not in school. At this point, some teachers may be saying, “I can’t get my kids to hand in a worksheet, let alone rely on them to learn on their own.” And of course, effective use of homework in class relies on creating a strong system of accountability for getting kids to do it. This should include a schoolwide grading policy—at Success schools, missing and incomplete homework assignments receive a zero; students can get partial credit for work handed in late; and middle and high schoolers can revise their homework for a better grade—as well as consistently and explicitly noticing when kids are or are not prepared and offering praise and consequences.",

Is There Life after Death? ### What happens when we die? Even though our body dies, our spirit—which is the essence of who we are—lives on. Our spirit goes to the spirit world. The spirit world is a waiting period until we receive the gift of resurrection, when our spirits will reunite with our bodies. Our future resurrected body cannot die and will be perfect—free from pain, sickness, and imperfections. It is because of the infinite love of Jesus Christ that everyone will be resurrected.",

What Near-Death Experiences Say About God!\nDr. Mayim Bialik\n2029999 subscribers\n15804 likes\n611159 views\n6 Jun 2025\nWhat if death isn't the end but a doorway to something far greater? \n\nOn Mayim Bialik's Breakdown, Dr. Bruce Greyson, M.D. (author of After, Chester Carlson Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University of Virginia, and co-founder of the International Association for Near-Death Studies) shares the near-death experience (NDE) that shattered his medical skepticism and launched decades of consciousness research with Mayim & Jonathan. A Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, Greyson explores astonishing cases of tunnel visions, otherworldly reunions, and the powerful, peer-reviewed scientific evidence for life after death. Could it be that consciousness exists outside the brain? Discover why many say NDEs eliminate the fear of dying, trigger lifelong transformation, and may even unlock hidden psychic abilities.

People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives. CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns. CBT treatment also usually involves efforts to change behavioral patterns.

Scientologists believe that people are immortal alien beings (called *thetans*) who have forgotten their true nature and are trapped on earth in a human body. Scientologists also believe that by undergoing a series of classes and teachings (called *auditing* by the church), people can free themselves of their human form and reclaim their true selves. By taking all of the classes the Church of Scientology offers, Scientologists believe that one can reclaim his true thetan form, become closer to God (or the Supreme Being), and unlock abilities to control life, matter, energy, space, and time that have been repressed by being in human form. The Church of Scientology is legally recognized as a religion (with tax-exempt status) in eight countries, including the United States and Australia.

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture.",

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002).",

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain.",

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry.",

Sex workers may be in a position to have important information about crimes such as human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, but unless the work they themselves do is not treated as criminal, they are unlikely to feel safe reporting this information to the police. Human Rights Watch supports full decriminalization rather than the Nordic model because research shows that full decriminalization is a more effective approach to protecting sex workers’ rights. Research by Human Rights Watch and others indicates that decriminalization can help reduce crime, including sexual violence, against sex workers. **Aside from decriminalizing sex work, what other policies does Human Rights Watch support with regard to sex workers’ rights?**.",

Decriminalization would allow sex workers to maintain their livelihood without fear of violence or arrest, and access health care to protect themselves. In addition to decriminalization, there are other steps that lawmakers, advocates, prosecutors, and researchers can take to protect the rights of sex workers. Congress and state legislatures must take steps to fully decriminalize sex work and reform other policies affecting sex workers’ health and safety. Companies must ensure sex workers have full access to their goods and services and are not discriminated against or shut out due to the nature of their work. ## For All of Us.

It’s that old riddle that’s sparked many arguments through the ages: was it the chicken or the egg that came first?

(This leaves us with another eggsellent question: which came first, the amniote or the amniotic egg? Back to our original question: with amniotic eggs showing up roughly 340 million or so years ago, and the first chickens evolving at around 58 thousand years ago at the earliest, it’s a safe bet to say **the egg came first**. ## The first chicken eggs.

But eggs – which are just female sex cells – evolved more than a billion years ago, whereas chickens have been around for just 10,000 years. Taken at face value, there is no doubt that the egg came before the chicken. Even the specialised sort of eggs laid by birds, with their tough outer membrane, evolved more than 300 million years ago. The wild ancestor of chickens is generally agreed to be a tropical bird still living in the forests of Southeast Asia called the red junglefowl –  with other junglefowl species possibly adding to the genetic mix. ## Sign up to our weekly newsletter ## More on Which came first, the chicken or the egg?",

However, scientists from Switzerland and the U.S. have discovered that this animal contained genetic instructions from embryonic development, meaning that the eggs existed even before life itself. “This paper gets at the core question of developmental biology, which is how we go from one cell to a whole animal, by looking at a related process in a weird, microbial relative to animals,” John Burns, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory in Maine said in a press statement.",

Some people experience side effects or lack of efficacy with antidepressants because their genetic makeup affects their drug metabolizing enzymes.

McAllister-Williams states that the magnitude of therapeutic difference is the difference between drug and placebo, not absolute response to active drug and thus Kirsch’s study in fact supports the idea that antidepressants efficacy increases with depression severity [McAllister-Williams, 2008]. Huge variation at the patient level in antidepressant response is overlooked; indeed a patient-level meta-analysis found the magnitude of benefit of antidepressant treatment compared with placebo increased with the severity of depression [Fournier *et al.* 2010]. A more recent meta-analysis [Gibbons *et al.* 2012] re-analysing these data sets failed to show an increase in suicide risk in young people on either venlafaxine or fluoxetine, although they showed therapeutic benefit in the treatment of their depression; in working age and older adults there was a decrease in suicidal thoughts and behaviour that was mediated by treatment of depression.

A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. You may be offered behavioural couples therapy if relationship problems could be contributing to your depression, or if involving your partner could help with your treatment.

Studying abroad is a transformative experience that benefits students during their studies and long after. Studying abroad can give students a fresh perspective on learning and education by providing an external perspective. Studying abroad will expose students to new educational styles and often allows students to learn more about learning itself. Studying abroad is not only a great personal and educational experience, it can strengthen students’ employability. Studying abroad usually takes students outside of this familiar context and can challenge their perspectives on the world and assumptions about fundamental aspects of life such as relationships, education, career, and family. Students from any background will develop a new sense of independence when they study abroad. Studying abroad requires students to become self-sufficient and learn new skills. Students who have studied abroad can bring a unique perspective to the table and shows that you are willing to try something new and work through challenges.",

When animals are used for product toxicity testing or laboratory research, they are subjected to painful and frequently deadly experiments. However, many people believe that animal testing is justified because the animals are sacrificed to make products safer for human use and consumption. However, animal experimentation in medical research and cosmetics testing cannot be justified on the basis that animals are lower on the evolutionary chart than humans since animals resemble humans in so many ways. In conclusion, animal testing should be eliminated because it violates animals' rights, it causes pain and suffering to the experimental animals, and other means of testing product toxicity are available. Humans cannot justify making life better for themselves by randomly torturing and executing thousands of animals per year to perform laboratory experiments or to test products.",

Reasons may include the focus on phasing-in NAMs over phasing-out animal use and the focus on transition within the regulatory sphere, although most animals are used in basic research. This paper employs the insights of French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, to explore the persistence of animal research within academia. Several of Bourdieu’s concepts are applied, including field and habitus, but perhaps it is his concept of capital that is most valuable in this context, providing a valuable shorthand for discussing the system of rewards and penalties within academia, clarifying how animal research converts into symbolic as well as social and economic capital and elucidating what scientists risk if they attempt to transition from animal research to NAMs. Bourdieu reminds us to attend to power relationships, particularly the relationship between the animal research field and the field of power.",

Specifically, understanding the viewing habits of various audiences (e.g., light versus heavy viewers of Disney animated films) relative to beliefs about family structures may provide greater insight into the influence of prevalent children’s media on social norms and behavior.",

So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns.

NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and scheduled to launch no later than May 2027), could zero in on a distant planet’s reflected light to detect the signatures of oxygen, water vapor, or some other powerful indication of possible life.

Since Hollywood gets it wrong, and it’s actually very difficult to kill another human being, the general public is relatively unaware of reflex training — the training responsible for 90% of American soldiers firing at Vietnamese soldiers. There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”. The point of all this is that the nature of war requires conditioning people to fight for people they are trained to see as family.",

For Barbara Reynolds, former civil rights activist, “activists in the 1960s confronted white mobs and police with dignity and decorum… But at protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot.”10 From Protests to Ethno-Racial Coalitions Turning to the question of its impact, BLM protests have helped frame American politics.",

While these incidents should be investigated and any impropriety addressed legally, financially, and organizationally, some people are using these incidents to question their own commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement. While unsolicited martyrs have become symbols of the Black Lives Matter movement, one key statistic drives it—Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be killed by police when they are unarmed and not attacking, and as in the case of Trayvon Martin, more likely to be profiled because of race.

I believe there's an equally valid moral argument for affirmative action that avoids the punitive overtones of the justice approach, focusing instead on why these programs are in everyone's best interest. In resolving the affirmative action question for myself, I find the best guidance in a common good approach to ethics.

By promoting higher diversity in learning environments, affirmative action not only enhances the educational experience, but also promotes critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

As with many current uses, dental applications for botulinum toxin therapy are provided “off label,” as doctors may use approved products for conditions not yet given the FDA nod. A majority of the medical conditions for which botulinum toxin has been approved land in the neurology and movement disorder realm, Aslam said, with dystonia and spasticity two chief disorders she treats with the injections. Patients sometimes opt for the therapy over other medications for their condition because they like the more localized approach with botulinum toxin injections, Aslam said.",

Some proactive arguments for cellphone use include accelerated learning, access to digital content, and a communication tool to parents for student safety. Science teachers, business education teachers, and students who are interested in information technology (IT) may find researching the inner components of a cell phone interesting. Learning what’s inside of a cell phone can be a way for students to learn about the technology they use every day, and how it can be beneficial for communication and networking. This includes choosing specific educational content for students, designating device-free time in classrooms and at home, and modeling proper expectations and behavior for phone use. Managing cell phones in schools should be a priority to protect the learning environment for students.

Michael Rich, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H.

Pereira’s approach is to step back — and to ask whether a student who can’t resist the phone is a signal that the teacher needs to work harder on making a connection. “Two things I try to share with my new teachers are, one, why is that student on the phone?

Student use of cell phones during an unfolding emergency can distract their attention from safety and emergency response directions being given by school staff. Therefore the use of cell phones by students and others in the immediate school community could potentially decrease, not increase, school safety during a crisis. Cell phone use, texting, and other outside communications by students during a crisis also expedites parental flocking to the school at a time when school and public safety officials may need parents to be away from the school site due to evacuations, emergency response, and/or other tactical or safety reasons.",

Schools must carefully weigh the pros and cons when deciding how to handle cellphone use during the school day. ### Pros of cellphone use. One of the biggest benefits of cellphones is their ability to give students access to educational resources. ### Cons of cellphone use. Some students use their phones to cheat on tests or plagiarize work, which can go against school policies and harm their own learning. Schools may face legal risks if students misuse their phones or if privacy issues arise due to phone use in the classroom. Cellphones can be useful tools in schools, but they also bring risks. Schools need to find a balance, allowing students to use their phones in helpful ways while keeping distractions and problems under control.",

In the proposed 1985 system, a replay official would have monitored the game feed from an in-stadium booth and initiated all reviews, reversing a call only with “indisputable visual evidence.”. Instant replay’s first regular season saw an average of 1.6 reviews per game. “My buddy, the instant replay guy,” Williams jokingly said after the game. Instant replay review was back in the NFL. Instant replay is an accepted part of the game,” said Atlanta Falcons general manager and Competition Committee Co-Chairman Rich McKay.

Professional athletes competing for money rather than for excellence will take the soul and magic out of sports, ruining it in the long run – for athletes and for fans. This trend holds a significant effect on players’ salaries: It helps some athletes get oversized contracts (what do Patrick Mahomes’ teammates think about his 2020 $503M contract?) while increasing income inequality between the majority of athletes. **The Bottom Line:** While it seems like there’s no way to stop such inflated salaries of professional athletes, the repercussions could cause long-term damage to professional sports.",

In some ways, *Wenger: My Life and Lessons in Red and White*is written particularly with Arsenal fans in mind, assuming they can fill in gaps in the narrative from memory while Wenger tries to mollify their disappointment at the club maintaining a top-four level without ever claiming a league championship during his last fourteen years managing Arsenal FC.",

Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work. Next, take a look at the arguments in favor of paying college athletes for their work — with the emphasis on the word “work.” Collegiate sports do indeed represent a considerable commitment of time and effort, often resembling a full-time job. If few college athletes receive scholarships and fewer still receive full scholarships, and considering that playing college sports can be equivalent to a full-time job, then an argument could indeed be made that college athletes should receive salaries for their work.",

As Jon Solomon, Editorial Director for the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute explained, “The most glaring example occurred when the University of North Carolina was found by outside parties to have organized fake classes that enabled dozens of athletes to gain and maintain their eligibility… of the 3,100 students who took the fake classes over 18 years, 47.4 percent were athletes… North Carolina avoided NCAA penalties by essentially arguing that the NCAA should stay out of irregularities in college courses.” The NCAA polices athletes’ finances but does not ensure a quality education.

LeBron regarding clutch-time stats proves LeBron is better than Kobe was in the most important time of the game. In terms of being a team player, there is no comparison between Kobe and LeBron.

Two races capture the essence of these motorsports: F1’s Monaco Grand Prix and NASCAR’s Daytona 500. Formula 1 (F1) and NASCAR are two titans of racing, and the vehicles they employ in their contests are as different as night and day.

Though our clinical outcomes are mediocre by comparison [1], the average per capita cost of health care in the United States is twice that of other modern nations [2]. Roughly half of these costs would be recovered under single-payer and could be reallocated to the delivery of meaningful health care services [17, 18]. The United States has little national planning of health care resource allocation. Under a single-payer system, regional planning of resource allocation would be aligned with public health needs rather than duplicating services and driving up medically questionable utilization.

Congressional sponsors, as noted, claim that the substitution of broad-based federal taxation for private health insurance costs would result in most American families paying less for health care than they do today. For example, scholars at the Urban Institute, a prominent liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that a single-payer program would require a federal spending increase of $34 trillion over ten years, and total American health care spending would increase by $7 trillion. In summary, the adoption of a single-payer system covering more than 330 million Americans, particularly as outlined in the leading House and Senate bills, would guarantee a massive disruption of existing public and private health care coverage and delivery systems.",

Public support for the death penalty does not necessarily mean that taking away the life of a human being by the state is right. It needs to be pointed out that public support for the death penalty is inextricably linked to the desire of the people to be free from crime.

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country.",

These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

Those jobs pay between 15% to 20% more than the manufacturing jobs that moved out of the U.S. post-NAFTA. ## **Con 1: NAFTA led to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs.** NAFTA skeptics cite the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as a reason to criticize NAFTA and to be wary of future trade deals. While the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy suffered the heaviest job losses in the wake of NAFTA, wages decreased in many other sectors that don’t require workers to have a college degree.",

In Andrews’ telling, NAFTA was merely the first of several important free trade dominos to fall, setting off a “chain of events that allowed globalization to run free the way it did.” NAFTA’s entrance into force on January 1, 1994, she notes, was accompanied around the same time by other important milestones of expanded economic integration including the agreement creating the World Trade Organization, the formation of the European Union, and the opening of the Chunnel connecting the United Kingdom and France. More relevant when evaluating a free trade agreement are economic outcomes — and from that perspective, NAFTA looks pretty good.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

As a result, some people will complain that they don’t want to speak up because they fear being “criticized” or “stigmatized.” These people should recognize that their fear isn’t a sign of the environment’s political correctness or hostility toward free expression; it’s just a sign that they need more courage—for it requires courage to stay engaged with difference.",

Some people might think that the positive effects outweigh the side effets or costs and therefore may be more likely to decide to use the medicine. Others may think that the side effects would not be tolerable or worth the risk, so they may be more likely to decide not to use the medicine.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to place primary responsibility with the states for redistricting, but it also clearly preserves the ability of Congress to set federal rules as appropriate. Numerous states have had to redistrict following judicial rulings that their maps violate principles of the Constitution or other laws around redistricting. In Rucho v Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively leaving it up to plaintiffs to prove that any redistricting harm stems from something beyond party affiliation. Redistricting is a state process but is also governed by the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and judicial precedent. In most states, the legislature is responsible for drawing both their congressional and legislative district lines, typically through the standard lawmaking process and often subject to gubernatorial veto.",

Free to gerrymander, the Republican-controlled legislature redrew the map, and after the 2024 election, North Carolina saw three Democratic districts flip to Republicans, enough to give control of the U.S. House to the GOP by a slim margin.

Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

The initial Arab Spring was “like one giant Woodstock,” said Alaoui. “People might think that the region is stagnant, that we’ve simply gone back to the bad old days of Hosni Mubarak or other Arab autocrats who were exemplars of ossification and stagnation, but that masks a lot of change in the region currently happening,” said Tarek Masoud, Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy and the Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman Professor of International Relations. “The drivers of the change are not the photogenic, admirable, creative young people who brought us the Arab Spring,” he said. “My belief is that the Saudi government looked at these uprisings of young people across the region and said, ‘If we don’t change things, we are going to find that happening here, and we’re not going to be able to weather it,’” said Masoud.",

But with active presidents, Reagan among them, the verdict of history is likely to be many years in the coming. On all the major social issues-abortion, quotas, gay rights, feminism, crime and punishment, the family, moral and religious values-the Reagan administration has been conservative and correct, even if reasonable people might quarrel over details of policy and political strategy. All told, in my judgment as a conservative Democrat, President Reagan will be remembered more for the opportunities that slipped from his grasp than for achievements that reshaped the American political landscape. Reagan has indeed been as conservative a president as we could realistically hope to have but not a great one.",

According to Rufus King, “It was with the people that the Constitution meant to place the election of the Chief Magistrate.” The Constitution’s Electoral College Clause (Article II, section 1, clause 3) stipulates that electors from each state shall elect the president. However, most states adopted popular election of presidential electors in the 1810s and 1820s. Abolishing the Electoral College, however, would change the structure of the presidency to make it easier for popularly elected presidents to concentrate power in the executive branch. But the fact remains that a majority of the Electoral College elect’s presidents, not a majority of all Americans.

The Constitution is silent on whether states or the electors themselves ultimately can decide which candidate gets the electors’ vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed that issue in the handful of cases it has considered related to the Electoral College. In May of 2019, the Washington State Supreme Court **upheld** a state election law that said an elector who did not vote for the candidate he pledged to support could be fined up to $1,000 in civil penalties. If that occurs, the court might provide states additional guidance on just how much leeway they have to impact the Electoral College vote that decides the presidency of the United States.",

If no candidate wins the necessary 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives convenes in a “contingent election” and determines the winner with each state delegation getting one vote. Most controversies involving the Electoral College occurred when candidates win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College vote. The NPVIC is a legally binding agreement among states to award the electoral votes from their state to the national popular vote winner, regardless of whether the majority of voters in that state preferred another candidate. The NPVIC would only go into effect should the states in the agreement represent an electoral majority of at least 270 electoral votes. Currently, candidates focus on a handful of “battleground” states such as Ohio and Florida with close vote-margins and large electoral vote payouts.",

She argues that the Electoral College protects small state and minority interests and that a national popular vote would be “like two wolves and a sheep deciding what’s for dinner.”. The Electoral College was also intended to prevent states with larger populations from having undue influence and to compromise between electing the president by popular vote and letting Congress choose the president. Even Donald Trump, who benefited from the Electoral College system, stated after the 2016 presidential election that he believed presidents should be chosen by popular vote: “I would rather see it where you went with simple votes.

In Sudan, if the war-related famine again becomes severe, dividing the country into an Arab north and a Christian south may save the vast majority of threatened Sudanese lives at the lowest cost in dollars—and in the blood of intervening troops. But muscular interventions in wars like those in Angola and Congo will probably not happen until more countries develop the military capabilities for such operations—which brings us to the final question. Although the United States need not create a specialized armed force for peace operations, it should modify its military force structure to lessen the strain of various types of limited missions around the world. Even if such countries cannot be expected to lead forcible interventions, they can provide valuable combat forces that enable peacekeeping missions to uphold ceasefires and peace accords under challenge.",

When President Obama left office on January 20, 2017, his impact and legacy were unclear. With Republicans in control of both the presidency and the Congress in 2017, however, some of Obama’s most notable achievements—the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate change agreement, and Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals—were overturned or under attack. Obama’s lasting impact on American life may turn out to have been greatest in terms of the crises that did not happen. In a C-SPAN survey of 91 historians, political scientists, and other presidential scholars, Obama was ranked 12th among all presidents since George Washington for the overall quality of his performance as chief executive. Bush, who ranked 33rd, Bill Clinton (15th), and George H.W.

To name just a few central examples: the sheer hysteria about a modest healthcare bill – frequently labelled ‘the death of freedom’ by GOP politicians; the insane efforts to label Obama un-American (led by Trump!) and a dangerous Muslim; and, as important, the procedural radicalism of the congressional Republicans, engineered by the party’s top strategist, senate leader Mitch McConnell (shutting down the government, insisting on a supermajority requirement for every bill, denying Obama the right to fill the supreme court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Scalia, and much else).",

And from then on, the Obama presidency struggled under a radicalized Republican Party. Coleman notes, “In the summer of 2012, under pressure from party activists to show some effort on immigration reform before the November election and unable to rise above the partisanship that dominated Washington as he had hoped, President Obama turned to his executive powers and announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.” But again we see the weakness of executive action.",

This implies that concessions by elites to protester demands will be more likely during peak cycles of protest.”  The author analyzed whether protest is systematically related to two types of concessions: establishing a CRB and lowering fatalities of minorities. The author ultimately found that protests influence cities to establish more powerful citizen oversight boards and that they lower fatalities in minority communities. The American Sociological Association, founded in 1905, is a nonprofit membership association dedicated to serving sociologists in their work, advancing sociology as a science and profession, and promoting the contributions to and use of sociology by society.",

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful.",

There are two things Putin did that cemented the loyalty of Solzhenitsyn and other Russians—he restrained the billionaires who were looting the country, and he restored Russia’s standing abroad. Putin came to call these people “state-appointed billionaires.” He saw them as a conduit for looting Russia, and sought to restore to the country what had been stolen from it. Putin became president a half a year after Yeltsin was maneuvered into allowing the dismemberment of Russia’s ally, Serbia, and as he entered office Putin said: “We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians, or any threat to the integrity of the country.”. The degradation of Russia’s position represented by the Serbian War is what Putin was alluding to when he famously described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” This statement is often misunderstood or mischaracterized: he did not mean by it any desire to return to Communism.",

And yet, from Putin’s point of view, what he would say is, “I hear these things from presidents, they all say these things, but the policy stays the same.” And I think he has come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter who is president because America is still going to do what America does, and that the president can say whatever they want, but it doesn’t change that.",

Throughout, Stent analyzes Putin’s policymaking around key domestic and international developments to understand why Russia broke bad, the West’s role, and how should the United States deal with Russia in the future. The discussants debated the implications of Putin’s leadership and policies for smaller states in Russia’s near abroad, as well as for democratic backsliding in Central Europe and the rise of great power competition—notably, with China.

So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns.

Suppose we do go to Mars, he says, and find living organisms in the subsurface that are DNA based, like life on Earth.

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA.",

While the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy suffered the heaviest job losses in the wake of NAFTA, wages decreased in many other sectors that don’t require workers to have a college degree.",

More relevant when evaluating a free trade agreement are economic outcomes — and from that perspective, NAFTA looks pretty good.",

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.",

But actually not that much, as far as I can tell from my limited vantage point; investment banking is a pretty good grades-and-school meritocracy compared to, for instance, I don't know, real jobs.\\*\\*. Also there's a variant on step 2 that is like \"really, really want to be an investment banker.\" This used to be rare: in my college days, when jobs were plentiful and dot-coms were bubbling, investment banking was pretty much where you interviewed if you owned a suit and didn't have anything you were particularly passionate about and couldn't stomach law school. Investment banking has lost its cachet, and the only people applying to do it are people who want to be investment bankers. A better answer starts from recognizing that bankers, like all people though perhaps more so, tend to look out for themselves and so it's best for society if they're in some sort of system where their self-interest is channeled toward positive rather than negative ends.",

Investing in real estate may seem like a smart financial move, but it may be even smarter to compare it to investing in stocks before making any big decisions. The main difference between investing in real estate and investing in stocks is that real estate involves buying properties and renting them out or investing in REITs (real estate investment trusts), whereas investing in stocks involves buying a small slice of a company and waiting for those shares to increase in value. It’s also important to know that you can purchase shares in real estate investments without the headaches of actually buying, managing and selling properties. There are lots of metrics you can look at when figuring out if investing in real estate or stocks will make you more money. * Real estate investments can be more work than stocks. Getting your money out of a real estate investment through resale is much more difficult than the point-and-click ease of buying and selling stocks.",

While real estate and gold are two assets that can appreciate in value over time, the stock market will generally grow at a much higher rate, experts say. McClanahan also points out that unlike gold and real estate, stocks are diversified assets, meaning you're spreading out your cash versus concentrating it into one investment. If you are among the Americans that want exposure to real estate or gold, there are different ways to do it wisely, experts say.

In a new Upjohn Institute working paper, Daniel MacDonald and Eric Nilsson, of California State University, Bernardino, advance the literature on price effects of minimum wage increases. But many recent state and city-level minimum wage increases have been scheduled to be implemented over time and often are indexed to some measure of price inflation. These small, scheduled minimum wage hikes seem to have smaller effects on prices than large, one-time increases. They also observe that small minimum wage increases do not lead to higher prices and may actually reduce prices. While federal and state minimum wage increases appear to produce similar results, more research is needed to fully grasp the effects of city minimum-wage raises.

YSE Economists Kenneth Gillingham and Matthew Kotchen were part of a Yale team that analyzed the “Musk partisan effect” on the company’s U.S. sales. They, along with Jackson School of Global Affairs Dean James Levinsohn and School of Management Professor Barry Nalebuff, examined the impact of Musk's partisan actions on Tesla vehicle sales in the U.S. since October 2022. They found that not only would Tesla sales have been 67-83% higher without Musk’s partisan effect — equating to 1-1.26 million more vehicles sold — but Musk’s actions also boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17-22%. “The effect has been increasing over time, such that by the first quarter of 2025, we found that Tesla sales would have been about 125% higher than they were without the Musk partisan effect,” Kotchen said.",

Mr. Douthat is an Opinion columnist and the host of the “Interesting Times” podcast.

Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect.",

Republican support is much higher than it was in May 2020, when 56% favored more fracking. More broadly, majorities of Democrats oppose all forms of fossil fuel development we asked about in our recent survey, including offshore oil and gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and coal mining.

The time lag between planning and operation of a nuclear reactor includes the times to identify a site, obtain a site permit, purchase or lease the land, obtain a construction permit, obtain financing and insurance for construction, install transmission, negotiate a power purchase agreement, obtain permits, build the plant, connect it to transmission, and obtain a final operating license. The planning-to-operation (PTO) times of all nuclear plants ever built have been 10-19 years or more. Nuclear takes 5 to 17 years longer between planning and operation and produces on average 23 times the emissions per unit electricity generated (between 9 to 37 times depending upon plant size and construction schedule).",

Advocates of a wealth tax argue that it would be an effective means of raising revenues while addressing wealth and income inequality and affecting only a tiny fraction of U.S. households. To illustrate the basic concept, consider a simple example of a 2 percent wealth tax imposed on all individual or household net worth above $100 million (the exemption threshold). ### A Wealth Tax Would Raise Revenues. Using those estimates, if a 1 percent wealth tax were imposed on all assets comprising that base and no evasion occurred, the tax would raise an additional $94 billion, or about 3 percent of total federal revenues in 2019; if enforcement were weak and base erosion were 50 percent, the amount of revenues raised would be half as large.",

A wealth tax would require taxpayers to pay at regular intervals on the appreciation of their assets, regardless of whether they have the cash or liquid assets to pay. Under her plan, high-wealth taxpayers would likely pay taxes on their capital gains each year as their assets appreciate in value. Even a very wealthy individual may not have the liquid assets to pay the tax on their changes in wealth. Under Harris’s proposal, taxpayers who don’t have cash to pay taxes may  have to borrow money or sell. *Nathan Goldman and Christina Lewellen are associate professors of accounting in the Poole College of Management.*",

Apple’s promotional videos for its new headset—the Vision Pro, a metal-and-glass, ski-goggle-like apparatus that costs around thirty-five hundred dollars—show people experiencing V.R. for the first time. In the intervening decades, V.R. has thrived at two extremes in the quest for “killer apps.” It has long been an established industrial technology: if you’ve flown, ridden, or sailed in a factory-built vehicle in the last thirty years, virtual reality may have played a central role. Nonetheless, experiences will come from all kinds of companies, and V.R. could agitate and depress people even more than the little screens on smartphones. In the early days of V.R., I actually tried living in it all the time; on a number of occasions, I stayed in virtual reality for several days.",

Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections.

Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

Kahn, who studies retail, brand management and loyalty and related issues, said some specialty retail category killers and department stores are in a concerning position five years post-pandemic. As Macy’s closes stores, for example, Kahn said that retailer is trying to find the right balance between stores, e-commerce online shopping experience and exactly what a department store should offer in the post-COVID environment. More broadly, Kahn said some retailers are still struggling to align their inventory and have failed to invest in their store experience and sales associates.",

Alibaba is in the vanguard of designing, building, and operating e-commerce infrastructure, while keeping business costs down.

And, of course, make sure to communicate the benefit of crowdsourcing to your team — it should be a welcome help, not a threat, to their work. In order to ensure your data and work are safe, make sure the crowdsourcing partner you choose doesn't provide their members with access to real data sets.
