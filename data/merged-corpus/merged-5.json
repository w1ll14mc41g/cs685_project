        "content": "Surrealist memes find cultural forbears in the pre-internet art movements of Dadaism, Surrealism and Pop Art. Surrealist memes approach the absurdity of contemporary life in the same manner as Dadaism , which contended that art doesn’t need to make sense if governments and societies don’t make sense either. Surreal memes incorporate Surrealist and Dada styles, utilizing Salvador Dali-inspired meme bases, and montages that are reminiscent of collage techniques popularized by the Dada movement. The medium by which most memes are produced, with image macros that lays text over premade images, speaks to mass manufacturing, a focal point of the Pop Art movement. By referencing Dali in the same image as Pepe the Frog, surreal memes accomplish another central goal of Pop Art – to mix high and low culture and elevate ordinary, daily items into the world of fine art. This ongoing dialogue between various art movements and surreal memes points to the latter’s power as a driving force in the progression of meme art.",

Imageboard website 4chan has long claimed ownership of the internet’s most popular memes, and its users regularly scorn sites like 9gag and Reddit for their use (and hence, their popularization) of memes originally posted on 4chan. Surreal memes are but one manifestation of internet insiders’ preoccupation with keeping memes out of the hands of mainstream internet users. Because surreal memes deliberately avoid cultural references of any kind, they are not easily consumed or absorbed into the internet mainstream. Unlike the art world’s Dadaism, which sought to translate the confusing of the times to anyone who looked upon a Dadaist piece, surrealist memes actively repel audiences by using content that will only resonate with a select group of internet insiders (go ahead, pretend you understand any of these ). This pretension to exclusivity runs counter to the common axiom that art should be for the masses.",

To these critics, I (along with troves of surrealist memers) say, so what? Art needn’t have a particular message in order to qualify as art, or even to qualify as good art. As art journalist Jonathan Jones points out, distinguished artists like Mark Rothko and Nobel prize-winner Bob Dylan took pains to avoid meaning of any kind being attached to their work. Jones opines, “The most deadening influence on art in our time is the belief that content matters more than style.” Surreal memes evade easy understanding or categorization. They challenge their audience to accept that which cannot be easily googled, understood, and shared. Their seemingly meaningless content thwarts the easy consumption that meme culture propagates, making surreal memes no less an act of artistic rebellion than Dadaist Marcel Duchamp’s The Fountain .",

Art writer Linda Weintraub writes “If art doesn’t sensitize us to something in the world, clarify our perceptions, make us aware of the decisions we have made, it’s entertainment.” Internet memes, both popular and obscure, do give their audiences pause, drawing attention to the ills of our world with humor or shock value. But surreal memes in particular are unable to sensitize or clarify, because they intentionally lack both sense and clarity. They traffic in absurdity for absurdity’s sake, which leaves them little hope to evolve into something meaningful or new. Surreal memes can only “progress” through the intensification of nonsense ad nauseum. As the Art Factory said of Dadaism , “The DNA of Dada was self destructive [sic]”; so too is the DNA of the surreal meme.",

As a result, they take taxpayer's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state. Moreover, illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions. This is harmful to lawful residents because it takes employment opportunities away from them and encourages employers to seek illegal labour in order to keep costs down.

Spending long periods sitting in one place can slow your metabolism and contribute to developing potentially fatal blood clots. Not to mention that binge-watching may lead to binge-eating. While binge-watching may feel good in the moment, your body may disagree long-term.",

Binge-watching, by contrast, doesn’t provide the time needed for after-thoughts and discussions, central to the community-building experience. Viewer discussions around mystery or action TV shows, like “Did Daenerys Targaryen really have to destroy Kings Landing?” or “Did Tony Soprano live or die?” are less likely to happen when the mystery is solved or reasoning explained minutes after the question was posed. Additionally, the binge-watching phenomenon attests to the lack of patience that characterizes modern society. We’re used to getting everything immediately and aren’t good at waiting for things we want. Our need for instant gratification (and our inability to delay gratification) may not be good for people over time, and binge-watching is a major example of this problem.",

Mandating that all forms of art be released under a creative commons license is an absolute slap in the face to artists and to the artistic endeavour as a whole. It implies that somehow the work is not entirely the artist’s own, that because it is art it is somehow so different as to be worthy of being shunted into the public sphere without the real consent of the artist.

But while film studios raced to combat the last few years of instability in the entertainment industry, this data analysis shows that opportunities for people of color fell across the board after recent gains, while women also saw a drop as writers, even as their share of lead roles increased. Even as the domestic and global box offices responded positively to diverse films, Hollywood’s progress slid in terms of race, ethnicity and disability, while women posted gains in a few categories. Another look at investment found that like 2023, white women directors were more likely than white men or people of color to helm films with lower budgets; 45.5% of their films had budgets less than $20 million."

It’s understandable, then, that changes had to be made to the story for the stage adaptation but they also take away from some of the depth of the original story.",

Additionally, tests like the SATs may be biased towards those students who come from money; if they can afford to go to an expensive school or prep course, and if they have more time to study because they don’t have to work, then they will most likely perform better on such tests.",

This helps schools benchmark their students' educational outcomes against a broad sample used during the standardization process. 5. With a consistent measure of student achievement, standardized exams allow for meaningful district comparisons and help maintain educational standards nationwide. Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge."

U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona once said that tests can be a “flashlight” on what works in education, and Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera has similarly noted that “actionable data is the foundation for improving performance and holding our schools accountable.” Alongside other indicators of student performance, tests provide teachers with actionable data that can help inform their instruction, such as whether students might need more help or acceleration in a certain subject or part of a subject."

For example, when allegations of sexual assault came out against Louis C.K., his close friend, Sarah Silverman , was among the first to comment. As the allegations were confirmed, more comics made statements fueling the conversation. Marc Maron, Jon Stewart and Bill Burr, were among friends and co-workers weighing in on the ugliness. A public apology fans the flame of interest and has the potential to spark further debate, which, ultimately, may bring awareness to sensitive issues like holding people accountable for their actions, which may further legitimize the victims’ feelings.",

Admittedly, parents in our world aren’t always what we wish them to be, but we insist that they do more harm than good. The Prop has denied the immense risks associated with abortion, which stretch from acute hematometra (post-abortal syndrome) to breast cancer, infertility, and increased risk for clinical depression and suicide. The suicide rate is nearly six times greater among aborting women than among women who give birth. These findings refute the oft-heard claim that induced abortion is safer than childbirth.” The myth that childbirth is more risky than abortion is largely based on the way that statistics about abortion-related deaths are collected: such deaths are often attributed to present problems. These are risks that parents have a right and a responsibility to evaluate for their minor children, who are by law as well as by custom the responsibility of parents. So why should abortions need consent when a decision to keep the child doesn’t? Quite simply, the nature of pregnancy in most cases necessitates parental involvement, since it is rarely kept a secret, and almost always requires emotional and material support. The law need not step in where immediacy does. In truth, each of the options, including abortion, carry with them serious and long-term risks that need to be not only carefully considered, but offset with the kind of support a parent is best able to give.",

If these results were to be reproduced in more environments, the Montessori method could prove to offer meaningful advantage over other traditional or alternative methods. More recent research compared the wellbeing of adults who had gone to Montessori school during childhood and those who went to conventional schools; the wellbeing surveys of the Montessori graduates showed strong evidence of elevated psychological wellbeing as adults.",

The Montessori philosophy values industriousness, and these educational discoveries are even referred to as “work.” Furthermore, Montessori does not value imaginative play like make-believe (like pretending to be a chef or a dragon) or emphasize social interactions. Many educators fear these practices are remiss, especially given the known benefits of pretend play for children’s cognitive and social development.

Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.",

Without this principle, the medical profession would lose a great deal of trust; and admitting that killing is an acceptable part of a doctor’s role would likely increase the danger of involuntary euthanasia, not reduce it. Legalising assisted suicide also places an unreasonable burden on doctors. The daily decisions made in order to preserve life can be difficult enough; to require them to also carry the immense moral responsibility of deciding who can and cannot die, and the further responsibility of actually killing patients, is unacceptable. This is why the vast majority of medical professionals oppose the legalisation of assisted suicide: ending the life of a patient goes against all they stand for. The Hippocratic Oath that doctors use as a guide states 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.'",

Quality of life judgements are private and personal, thus only the sufferer can make relevant decisions. People are given a large degree of autonomy within their lives and since deciding to end your life does not physically harm anyone else, it should be within your rights to decide when you wish to die. While the act of suicide does remove option to choose life, most cases in which physician assisted suicide is reasonable, death is the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process.

The law cannot adapt to the specificity and multitude of ethical problems that arise on a situational basis. The law can only take into account circumstances that it foresees and can elaborate on. The highly personal and situational nature of this issue deems it insufficient for legislation, which exists outside the realm of the personal.

People, particularly when in desperate situations, tend to overestimate a treatment’s efficacy. Given that these treatments are still undergoing the trial process, it is possible that they are ineffective, or have side-effects that outweigh any benefits. Thus, to allow such drugs and treatments to be handed out during the testing process, there is a great risk of giving people false hope. This is especially the case given the compromised role of the physician in this scenario: ordinarily, if a patient wants an experimental drug, they can have a discussion with their physician that stresses the ‘in trial’ nature of the drug, and thus the uncertainty of it working. Subsequent experiences (the inconveniences of trials; filling in forms and receiving expenses) reinforce the idea that these drugs were experimental, and that the bulk of the benefit from the trial accrues for future patients. Consequently, in that scenario it is easier for the physician to help the patient to come to terms with the end of life; to deal with this and to realise that any trial drugs give only a slim chance of improvement. In the scenario envisaged by this proposition, experimental drugs can be acquired as easily as licensed ones, and therefore there is no longer that clear distinction for the patient between ‘doing all you can’ in the ordinary sense, (trying every treatment that is known to be effective) and trying ‘one more (experimental) drug’. Therefore, the patient is less likely to be able to come to terms with their own condition, and therefore less likely to be able to deal with the emotional trauma inflicted not only upon them, but on close family and loved ones.",

However, these taxes, as well as warning labels, allow Americans to make educated decisions about their health and food choices. Evidence suggests that warning labels effectively reduced smoking.

With the exception of the District of Columbia's special sales tax rate (8 percent, instead of its 6 percent general sales tax rate), all current soda taxes are based on a drink's volume. As such, the District of Columbia and Philadelphia are the only jurisdictions that tax diet sodas. #### What are other options for taxing soda? All per unit soda taxes in the United States are based on an eligible drink’s volume and not its sugar content.

In ancient times, people lacked the knowledge to explain natural phenomena and so they would make up stories to make sense of the world. As such, illness was recounted as punishments for wrongful acts, and natural disasters served were interpreted as heavenly omens. The flood described in the Bible story of Noah’s Ark can be understood as an especially massive flood in the Black Sea basin roughly some 8,000 years ago. The locusts’ outburst in the Bible’s Ten Plagues story can be explained in scientific terms. These stories are, therefore, not historically accurate because they rely on an outdated understanding of the world.",

While a national history full of patriotism may be good for instilling a love of the nation it is not much use at teaching anything else. In particular it is damaging to any attempt to teach analysis and the use of sources through history. History is for the most part not useful in and of itself,  there are for example very few jobs directly working with history. Rather teaching of history emphasises ‘transferrable skills’ such as Critical Analysis, Reasoning and Argument  all of which are suppressed if focused on one officially approved narrative. Moreover having the darker side of a nation’s past both makes history more interesting and more believable and so making it more likely that those being taught it will relate to it. Making the past look whiter than white simply makes it seem out of touch with reality. It makes for a poor teacher as history needs to ‘teach by example’ and if that example is not a complex character that can be related to it has little relation to every day experience.",

If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture."

        "content": "As we’ve mentioned in our previous point, prostitution will take place whether it is legal or not. We believe prostitution should be legal. By regulating brothels and the conditions for prostitution through regular health checks, condoms et cetera, we can make sure prostitutes are safe from HIV. In places where prostitution is illegal, it is merely driven underground; controlled by cartels and gangs. In this situation prostitutes live under no rights. If a sex worker contracts AIDS, a man or woman client using them will be at risk of contracting the virus, they then run the risk of not knowing that they have it, infecting other sexual partners and the cycle continues. Also let us not forget future children who contract the disease while in the uterus. So it is in countries where prostitution is illegal where we can’t keep sex workers safe from AIDS. In these countries prostitutes aren’t even allowed to be prostitutes. They tend to enter the profession because they have no other way of earning money or they may be forced to do it. On the other hand, if prostitution is legal and regulations are put in place, sex workers will be safer from STI’s and HIV/AIDS. Regular health checks will pick up any possible infections and there will be laws to protect the well-being of sex workers. What’s more, these laws will not only protect sex workers, but their clients too. Making prostitution legal will improve the work conditions of people who have to go into prostitution for one reason or another and will protect society from a further spreading of HIV/AIDS.

It is perfectly possible for a Government to provide an education program and legalise prostitution at the same time, in fact that is what is done in places like New Zealand where prostitution is legal and we provide sex education in schools. In fact, legalising prostitution actually helps a wider education program. If the opp wants people to be properly educated about AIDS, then they should not want to exclude and stigmatise sex workers. If you continue to ban prostitution, then it actually entrenches the idea that prostitutes are somehow lesser people whose welfare we shouldn't care about when it comes to HIV. As it is, countries that ban prostitution make no effort to protect prostitutes at all. To have a free and open discussion, it is necessary to allow a free discussion about prostitution, which can only happen if it is legal. If it is not, it is much more difficult to acquire information about prostitutes and about the conditions in which they work, because they are less willing to come forward and admit to what they are doing. The opp has conceded that there is a problem of people having unsafe sex with prostitutes, and yet it seems like the only group of people they want to exclude from their education program are the prostitutes themselves. If we can identify who the prostitutes are, then we can educate them. If prostitution is illegal and forced underground, we can't provide them with info. In addition, we can't provide information with people who use prostitutes, both because they won't admit to committing an illegal act and because banning prostitution increases the stigma on these people. The prop has missed the point entirely when they say we will be unable to enforce regulation, because it will be in the interests of the prostitutes and brothels to abide by regulations and report those who don't.",

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002)."

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain."

This is because there was once a proto-chicken – a bird resembling a chicken, but not quite of chicken status – that went about its business laying and fertilizing an egg. However, this egg carried some sort of genetic mutation that turned it into the chicken we have now come to know and love. Because the parents of the first chicken egg were birds that weren’t yet chickens, it appears that the egg did, indeed, come first. In addition, eggs of other birds predated chickens by millions of years, and there are fossils to prove it. The Archaeopteryx – largely accepted as the world’s oldest and first bird , and the closest living being of ancient times to resemble a chicken – left behind fossils from 150 million years ago, give or take. So, in comparison to other types of birds, chickens came rather late to the evolutionary party.",

Additionally, chickens create eggs more quickly than other animals do, but they need the protein to help speed up the process.

However, due to the expense of these instruments and the time required for body fat assessments, obesity is clinically defined by measures that ‘estimate’ adiposity from body weight, body build and height. The body mass index (BMI) is another measure used to define overweight and obesity and is considered a more accurate estimate of body fatness than IBW. Weight gain causes a number of hormonal, metabolic and molecular changes in the body that increase the risk for even greater fat accumulation. Such obesity-associated biological changes reduce the body’s ability to oxidize (burn) fat for energy, increase the conversion of glucose (carbohydrate) to fat, and increase the body’s capacity to store fat in fat storage depots (adipose tissue). Weight gain, therefore, changes the biology of the body in a manner that favors further weight gain and obesity."

It’s also been said that he have burned or destroyed many of papers and case notes over the years, so proof is elusive. In addition, it’s known that Freud didn’t welcome criticism or discussion. For example, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung was banished from professional circles after he dared to question Freud, who saw himself as the only authority on psychoanalysis, thereby limiting what could have led to expanded discussion and discoveries of other thought leaders of the time.

Freud’s focus on sexual explanations for psychological incidents has been seen as simplistic.

Experts at that time resorted to hypnosis or dubious treatments that included static electricity or bloodletting, among others. Drugs were also used, but more to subdue patients rather than treat them. The overriding conclusion pre-Freud was that mental illness was a result of physical impairment to the brain. His pioneering ideas sought to look deep into the human psyche and seek insights into the sources of people’s emotional conflicts. In so doing, he transformed people’s understanding of human behavior, especially with regard to treating mental disorders instead of just (mis)classifying them.

The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation.

The constant bickering over who gets what is a great emotional damage that can be countered by pre-nups. During a divorce process where a pre-nup is considered the parties get what they agreed on. Their tension and anger towards each other is minimized and they can go their separate ways in a more humane and civilized way. This is especially important to couples with children. Children suffer greatly during divorce procedures as they dehumanize former partners and turn them against each other. When relations spoil to that extent children get the greatest share of emotional trauma. We don't think that anybody should suffer to that extent and this is why people should be allowed to counter this sort of damage by entering into pre-nups. Lengthy divorce battles may not always produce fair outcomes. The person who is more prone stress, will at some point no doubt feel that s/he will do whatever only to end the nightmare of courts. This may entice him to give ground on certain matters, for example relinquish some of his property, only to reach a settlement faster. This outcome may not be fair, because the person is acting under the duress.

Certainly, no one has accused Stanford's admissions officers of being racist, so perhaps the real problem with affirmative action is that we are pretending to solve a problem that no longer exists. Perhaps the most tragic side effect of affirmative action is that very significant achievements of minority students can become compromised.

By the 1950s, Dr. Vernon Brooks discovered that botulinum toxin type A could inhibit the release of neurotransmitters, leading to muscle paralysis. The botulinum toxin makes its way into the ends of nerves that control muscle contraction.

Learning what’s inside of a cell phone can be a way for students to learn about the technology they use every day, and how it can be beneficial for communication and networking. This includes choosing specific educational content for students, designating device-free time in classrooms and at home, and modeling proper expectations and behavior for phone use.

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.",

This commodification of the human body and mind can go so far that humans actually start selling themselves: free market proponents propose to legalize the selling of one’s own organs.

This becomes even more pronounced when we take into account that the free market exacerbates inequality: if someone is born into a poor family and can’t get out of it, it might seem the only way to get out of it, is to sell oneself.

        "content": "Though overshadowed by widespread negative coverage, the NFL’s national anthem protests have led to positive developments. At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice.",

That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest. For many , NFL games – and post-game analyses – no longer provide an escape from draining politics but have turned into an unwelcome extension of it.",

Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work.

In fact, the blood often seen in MMA is caused by blows to the nose or facial cuts, which tend to look much worse than they are. Unlike other athletes that compete very regularly, MMA fighters only get into the ring between one and five times year . Training happens in very safe conditions, making serious injury very unlikely.

While the 2022 men’s national team that played in Qatar reportedly only had 3 Latino players , it’s hard to ignore this small but potentially growing influence that immigrants have on US soccer. Immigrants specifically from Mexico or Brazil tend to bring along their love for the sport, spreading it to their kids.

        "content": "The male world-view which dominates sports media and conveys to the public that women’s sport are inferior to men’s reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and deter young girls from becoming active in sport. Gender perceptions have obviously come a long way in the last 100 years, but the media classification of women’s sport as inferior to men’s is severely slowing this progress in the field of sport. Humans are social beings with esteem needs, and as social beings we like to be viewed in a positive light by our peers. This is best achieved on a general level by conforming to social expectations and norm. This also applies for societal conceptions of gender. The fact that the media deems women’s sport to be of lesser importance which (as we have seen) conveys to the public this message, reinforces the notion that sport is not a worthwhile activity for women and girls. Instead, it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys. This kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves. In this way, the lack of media coverage of women’s sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one’s ability; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do. This is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women. As more women take part in sport, this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which, in turn, induces further women to become engaged in sport. This is a desirable outcome from the government’s perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active. Those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like Coronary Heart Disease and cancer, but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising, and the joy of feeling physically fit.",

A lethal injection, or a few bullets, costs far less than keeping a person incarcerated for a long time, especially if they need long term health or other care in old age. The longer someone is in jail the greater the cost to the state. The costs of the implementation of the death penalty are driven up by anti-death penalty activists using the appeals system. Since the death penalty would only be applied to the worst of the worst when there is absolute moral certainty there would be less need for extensive appeals because there would be less marginal cases.",

While the cost of the actual execution may be minimal, the overall costs surrounding a capital case (where the death penalty is a potential punishment) are enormously high. Sources say that defending a death penalty case can cost around four times higher than defending a case not seeking death. Even in cases where a guilty plea cancels out the need for a trial, seeking the death penalty costs almost twice as much as cases that don’t. And this is before factoring in appeals, which are more time-consuming and therefore cost more than life-sentence appeals, as well as higher prison costs for death-row inmates.",

        "content": "The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1. In short, the death penalty can- and does- save the lives of innocent people. \"The Death Penalty Deters Crime and Saves Lives,\" August 28,2007.

The Constitution’s 8th and 14th Amendments recognize the death penalty BUT under due process of the law. This means that certain legal requirements must first be fulfilled before any state executions can be legally carried out – even when pertaining to the cruelest, most cold-blooded murderer .

It is noteworthy that in many retentionist states, the effectiveness of the death penalty in order to prevent crime is being seriously questioned by a continuously increasing number of law enforcement professionals. Public support for the death penalty does not necessarily mean that taking away the life of a human being by the state is right.

Some countries execute people who were under the age of 18 when the crime for which they have been convicted was committed, others use the death penalty against people with mental and intellectual disabilities. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, guilt or innocence or method of execution**.

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country."

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA."

A study examining America’s partisan divide found growing evidence of polarity among citizens across counties, states and regions. For example, there was an 8% increase in polarization between 2008 and 2012, irrespective of redistricting changes. In other words, Americans themselves are becoming more extreme in their political views, and are, therefore, voting in more extreme candidates. Diversity within each party is sharply narrowing; the Pew Research Center identified a widening gap between Democrats and Republicans on a number of values, up by 21% from 1994.

Numerous states have had to redistrict following judicial rulings that their maps violate principles of the Constitution or other laws around redistricting. In Rucho v Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively leaving it up to plaintiffs to prove that any redistricting harm stems from something beyond party affiliation.

In Afghanistan, he upped his predecessor’s support for anti-Soviet forces, leading the USSR to flee. At the same time, he was restrained in the use of military force.

Second, what outsiders might see as Israeli hostility toward Palestinians can be seen as a reaction to life-threating violence . The history of conflict and terrorism – which isn’t relegated to history but, sadly, a part of the country’s present – has led to necessary defensive security measures, such as border checkpoints and controls, aimed at protecting Israeli citizens from repeated terrorist attacks. Israelis strongly feel that if they don’t manage the Palestinian situation, they and their family members can be raped and murdered . It’s as simple as that.

According to Rufus King, “It was with the people that the Constitution meant to place the election of the Chief Magistrate.” The Constitution’s Electoral College Clause (Article II, section 1, clause 3) stipulates that electors from each state shall elect the president. However, most states adopted popular election of presidential electors in the 1810s and 1820s. Abolishing the Electoral College, however, would change the structure of the presidency to make it easier for popularly elected presidents to concentrate power in the executive branch. But the fact remains that a majority of the Electoral College elect’s presidents, not a majority of all Americans. Abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote would strengthen a president’s claim to speak for a majority of the American people."

Most controversies involving the Electoral College occurred when candidates win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College vote. The NPVIC is a legally binding agreement among states to award the electoral votes from their state to the national popular vote winner, regardless of whether the majority of voters in that state preferred another candidate. The NPVIC would only go into effect should the states in the agreement represent an electoral majority of at least 270 electoral votes.

This is why hate crimes frequently include highly public acts such as lynchings in town squares, dragging hate crime victims behind cars along streets inhabited by certain communities, and graffiti on significant buildings -they are intended to send a message. Hate crime-delivered messages limit the freedom of expression and group association of the victim community, thus violating their liberties.

When Americans use drones for targeting killings, other countries are likely to follow her lead. For example, China has weighed using drone strikes in Myanmar to deter illegal drug trade. With the definition of terrorist groups highly dependent on the goals of each individual government, it’s easy to imagine how drone warfare could devolve into a free-for-all. Another example: the use and availability of drones are increasing casualties and intensities of regional clashes in areas like Armenia and Azerbaijan that, until now, have been limited by such countries’ inability to wage air campaigns. On a larger scale, a 2022 deadly drone attack in the middle of Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels may mean an escalation of violence in an already volatile region. And let’s not forget about Syria, where the US and Russia are supporting opposing sides. US drone strikes (unintentionally?) hit a Russian-made tank as well as Russian military bases during previous defensive strikes against pro-Syrian forces. Who’s to say such drone strikes won’t lead to a tit-for-tat?",

Drones proved adept in reaching the remote areas of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria, among other countries, where the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, among others, conducted (and still do) their terrorist activities. Daniel Blyman, a researcher with the Center for Middle East Policy, points out that drone strikes not only “defanged” al-Qaeda by neutralizing high-ranking combatants (and even the highest-ranking leaders, as was the case with Biden’s 2022 drone strike against Osama bin Laden’s predecessor, Ayman al-Zawahiri ), but also made it nearly impossible for them to train new combatants, convene, or use telecommunications of any kind. More than accomplishing American counterterrorism objectives, drone strikes are often the only defense local communities in tribal regions of countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have against terrorist groups that tyrannize them. For those who are regularly subjected to suicide bombings or whose children risk being abducted and taken to terrorist training camps, drone strikes provide a much-welcomed reprieve from terrorists’ violence. Not to mention, drone technology keeps advancing to make them even more efficient and effective: Take for instance just one development that allows operators to coordinate multiple drones simultaneously and overwhelm aggressors’ defensive capabilities.",

In general, drone strikes cost far less in human life than other kinds of warfare. This is owing to drone strikes’ precision. Whereas airplanes must quickly fire their weapons and depart the area, drones can hover above their targets for several hours, providing real-time surveillance that allows operators to detect non-combatants and wait for them to evacuate before firing. Additionally, drone weaponry is significantly smaller than those used in airstrikes. Their small blast radius safeguards against collateral damage, and they even have features that allow a misfire to be quickly corrected.

Remotely operated drone strikes preserve soldiers’ lives by removing them from the site of conflict, full stop. The Pentagon’s 2024 fiscal-year budget of $842 billion, the largest, nominal-dollar peacetime budget ever, includes spending requests for the procurement of 1000 drone wingmen to accompany combat aircraft. That’s already thousands of lives saved. Moreover, depending upon the type of drone, they can cost more than $18.5K per flight per hour, drones are still cheaper to build than bombers and far easier to maintain (and protect) than a standing army.

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful."

Putin became president a half a year after Yeltsin was maneuvered into allowing the dismemberment of Russia’s ally, Serbia, and as he entered office Putin said: “We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians, or any threat to the integrity of the country.”. The degradation of Russia’s position represented by the Serbian War is what Putin was alluding to when he famously described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” This statement is often misunderstood or mischaracterized: he did not mean by it any desire to return to Communism."

NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA."

In Andrews’ telling, NAFTA was merely the first of several important free trade dominos to fall, setting off a “chain of events that allowed globalization to run free the way it did.” NAFTA’s entrance into force on January 1, 1994, she notes, was accompanied around the same time by other important milestones of expanded economic integration including the agreement creating the World Trade Organization, the formation of the European Union, and the opening of the Chunnel connecting the United Kingdom and France. More relevant when evaluating a free trade agreement are economic outcomes — and from that perspective, NAFTA looks pretty good."

It seems that this hurting of the general public is a tool that unions will use to get what they want. Moreover, union violence has been used in the past, such as in the Occupy Oakland strike of 2011, which culminated in violent riots that were later condoned by the US Supreme Court.

Conversely, if the app is predominantly aimed at markets where the iPhone has a stronger presence than Android devices, going for iOS is the preferable option."

        "content": "Because the federal minimum wage is not indexed for inflation, its purchasing power (the number of goods that can be bought with a unit of currency) has dropped considerably since its peak in 1968. The minimum wage in 1968 was $1.60, which is equivalent to $11.16 in Jan. 2016 dollars and which is 53.9% higher than today's $7.25 federal minimum wage. Between July 2015 and the last increase in the minimum wage in 2009, the federal minimum wage lost 8.1% of its purchasing power to inflation. According to Liana Fox, PhD, Senior Analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, \"inflation indexing guarantees low-wage workers a wage that keeps pace with the rising costs of goods and services.\" Raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation would ensure that low-wage workers could adopt a standard of living commensurate with the current economy.",

There is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure, since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families. Their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages. The minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices. Because people’s choices are intrinsically interconnected, and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply, when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else, he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask, leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another, each competing to prove he is worth the least. A minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition. People want to be happy, and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment. Fundamentally, the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited, giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies.",

In order to increase profits, firms will seek to exploit workers, to lower wages as far as possible. This exploitation will continue indefinitely, unless the state intervenes. The state does so by implementing a minimum wage. The lowest paid workers tend to be less educated, less skilled, and less organized than higher-paid employees. This makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace. Certainly, it is far better for state, which has citizens’ best interest at heart, to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses, which tend not to care about their workers’ welfare or have competing interests. Furthermore, a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation; it affirms that all people have worth, cannot be exploited, and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce, i.e. This is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society, by encouraging them to value themselves. Also, the minimum wage aids in promoting social justice and equality by lowering wage disparities. This form of social justice is certainly preferable to the class divisions propagated in the absence of a minimum wage, in which a part of society is relegated to permanent wage slavery.",

This can lead to negative self-esteem, envy, and unrealistic standards of success. Musk plays his own part in this comparison, creating the perception that he’s the sole embodiment of technological prowess. Yet, it’s easy to forget that, in reality, Musk wouldn’t have been able to get where he is without government funding , subsidies for electric cars, etc. Furthermore, Musk’s elevation by the public to a capitalist idol “has distorted the flow of capital and talent. Healthy markets don’t take cues from the tweets of one man,” writes American author and business professor Scott Galloway . For example, Musk’s outsized influence on raising (or lowering, in the case of Dogecoin ) the value, popularity and production of cryptocurrency has masked the truth that the high level of carbon emissions from increased mining of Bitcoin significantly reduces if not wipes out any carbon savings of Teslas.",

Because of Musk, analysts now believe that over half the cars sold by 2040 will be electric. In fact, he aims to sell 20 million electric vehicles in 2030 alone. According to consumer demand , the public agrees with Musk’s vision. Additionally, Musk has demonstrated that the space industry can be privatized, and for the better; his company SpaceX has seen the successful launch of rockets and their successful return back to Earth. It has succeeded in delivering supplies to the International Space Station. These show that privatization ventures may significantly reduce costs of space exploration.",

The unfortunate truth is that we live in a volatile global reality, where corruption and mismanagement of government budgets are both a reality for over half the world’s nations . We have provided evidence on the corrupted nature of many resource rich governments and this proves this is a problem that must be considered when looking at the effectiveness of implementing these high taxes. We have also continuously pointed out that one of the main issues associated with implementing a high tax in resource rich nations is the trust that can be held in their governments. We have raised this question a number of times and all we have heard in response is that “if governments... are not interested in the welfare of their people, this is a problem beyond the scope of our motion”. We feel this is in fact a major problem that must be dealt with prior to establishing a new global norm of high taxation on mining and extraction industries as the negative implications and costs to the majority of resource rich countries will be too great. The realistic social and political impacts that the implementation of such tax will have on ALL stakeholders involved has been considered by us but ignored by the prop. The Prop have also graciously agreed that by implementing a high tax “the companies will buy less in order to stay within their budget.” This only proves that the implementation of such high taxes will mean that companies will be forced to reduce spending on current technologies and practices rather than encourage investment in developing new, environmentally and economically sustainable ones. The Prop have made several unsubstantiated assertions throughout their argument and they have ignored the realistic negative effects that we have proven to exist. In particular the rise in the cost of commodities would devastate the people of those nations as well negatively effect both import and export profits.

If high taxes slow down economic growth, the government ends up taxing a smaller amount of money at a higher rate. Sometimes, this means a tax hike actually leads to lower total revenues, but even in less extreme cases, tax hikes yield diminishing returns .",

        "content": "While almost all major airlines charge for checked baggage (Southwest is still included for now), the cheaper airlines also make you pay for carry-on bags. Intercontinental flights (on legacy carriers) typically include luggage for both North American airlines and those based elsewhere. The target demographics of legacy (or full-service or whatever name you prefer for non-LCC) carriers is different from that of low-cost carriers (LCCs.) LCCs target primarily infrequent leisure travelers who choose flights primarily based on lowest price, even if the flights are less convenient and less reliable. Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between legacy carriers and LCCs is that legacy carriers typically have extensive loyalty programs designed to entice their highest-profit customers to keep their flying within that airline and its partners rather than shopping around for the cheapest flight for each trip."

Like Acorns, UK-based app Moneybox rounds up spare change from credit card purchases, saves it for you, and funnels it into investments. While small change sounds, well, small, let’s do the math. For example, say that the average user makes around 120 transactions per month and rounds up on average almost 40 cents per transaction. The small change adds up, as it’s nearly $48 saved each month and about $576 saved each year. Though not a significant enough amount of money to hurt your day-to-day dealings, over time, these investment apps will help your money will grow into something substantial.",

For instance, only one week after the US Capitol Building was infiltrated in 2021, FBI received tens of thousands of tips from people across the US in connection to the riot. In addition, e-sleuth hubs like the Doe Network continuously make headway on dozens of cold cases involving missing and unidentified persons.
