        "content": "Surrealist memes find cultural forbears in the pre-internet art movements of Dadaism, Surrealism and Pop Art. Surrealist memes approach the absurdity of contemporary life in the same manner as Dadaism , which contended that art doesn’t need to make sense if governments and societies don’t make sense either. Surreal memes incorporate Surrealist and Dada styles, utilizing Salvador Dali-inspired meme bases, and montages that are reminiscent of collage techniques popularized by the Dada movement. The medium by which most memes are produced, with image macros that lays text over premade images, speaks to mass manufacturing, a focal point of the Pop Art movement. By referencing Dali in the same image as Pepe the Frog, surreal memes accomplish another central goal of Pop Art – to mix high and low culture and elevate ordinary, daily items into the world of fine art. This ongoing dialogue between various art movements and surreal memes points to the latter’s power as a driving force in the progression of meme art.",

Imageboard website 4chan has long claimed ownership of the internet’s most popular memes, and its users regularly scorn sites like 9gag and Reddit for their use (and hence, their popularization) of memes originally posted on 4chan. Surreal memes are but one manifestation of internet insiders’ preoccupation with keeping memes out of the hands of mainstream internet users. Because surreal memes deliberately avoid cultural references of any kind, they are not easily consumed or absorbed into the internet mainstream. Unlike the art world’s Dadaism, which sought to translate the confusing of the times to anyone who looked upon a Dadaist piece, surrealist memes actively repel audiences by using content that will only resonate with a select group of internet insiders (go ahead, pretend you understand any of these ). This pretension to exclusivity runs counter to the common axiom that art should be for the masses.",

To these critics, I (along with troves of surrealist memers) say, so what? Art needn’t have a particular message in order to qualify as art, or even to qualify as good art. As art journalist Jonathan Jones points out, distinguished artists like Mark Rothko and Nobel prize-winner Bob Dylan took pains to avoid meaning of any kind being attached to their work. Jones opines, “The most deadening influence on art in our time is the belief that content matters more than style.” Surreal memes evade easy understanding or categorization. They challenge their audience to accept that which cannot be easily googled, understood, and shared. Their seemingly meaningless content thwarts the easy consumption that meme culture propagates, making surreal memes no less an act of artistic rebellion than Dadaist Marcel Duchamp’s The Fountain .",

Art writer Linda Weintraub writes “If art doesn’t sensitize us to something in the world, clarify our perceptions, make us aware of the decisions we have made, it’s entertainment.” Internet memes, both popular and obscure, do give their audiences pause, drawing attention to the ills of our world with humor or shock value. But surreal memes in particular are unable to sensitize or clarify, because they intentionally lack both sense and clarity. They traffic in absurdity for absurdity’s sake, which leaves them little hope to evolve into something meaningful or new. Surreal memes can only “progress” through the intensification of nonsense ad nauseum. As the Art Factory said of Dadaism , “The DNA of Dada was self destructive [sic]”; so too is the DNA of the surreal meme.",

The money from fines now goes straight to the Treasury. But when the money started rolling in from drivers caught by these new devices the authorities realised how much money can be made if they keep on planting new cameras. If it really wasn’t about the money then why have they focused so hard on an offence that causes just 5% of accidents and have done proportionally very little in preventing the other 95% causes of accidents? The PACTS reply (and the pilot study and all their other quoted analyses) is based on a gross misuse of the figures in Highways Economic Note #1 (HEN1), which gives estimates for costs associated with a road fatality, serious injury, etc and also the value of preventing a fatality (VPF). The Costs are the true costs to the county of an incident (emergency services, hospital, repairs to roads, etc. The report makes it clear that VPF includes amounts for pain, grief, loss of earnings, etc. Any use of VPF to show return on investment is bogus and potentially fraudulent. The values assigned to pain, grief, etc are hypothetical amounts that someone might be prepared to pay to bring their loved one back, and are to be used to compare alternative road schemes. Those values do not exist and would never appear on a balance sheet. To get £58M \"cost saving\" from two years of \"280 lives saved\", PACTS are using an average figure of about £100,000 as the costs of a fatality/serious-injury/minor-injury. This is a blatant misrepresentation of official government figures by a governemnt body. Further, most of the 280 reduction in KSI per year at camera sites is due to the statistical phenomenon \"regression to the mean\", in other words those 280 accidents would probably not have happened anyway, regardless of cameras. It is a fanciful number and bears no relation to reality (ask yourself how any camera can save a life!). So, with a massive reduction in costs per death/injury and a massive reduction in the number of \"lives saved by cameras\", the return on investment argument is exposed as totally bogus. I believe the \"return on investment\" in terms of safety/casualties is less than 5% per annum. I am currently pursuing this issue with the Head of Scrutiny with my local County Council, who have been using the same tricks. Bripe - an advanced driver and safety professional",

Thirdly, it allows young people to spend more time with the friends and people they already know through chat conversations, shared photos or status updates.

Freud’s focus on sexual explanations for psychological incidents has been seen as simplistic.

Pozner notes In her influential 2010 book *Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV*, reality programming “has the power to influence our notions of normalcy versus difference, convince us that certain behaviors are ‘innate’ for different groups of people, and present culturally constructed norms of gender, race, class, and sexuality as ‘natural,’” rather than as a reaction to external circumstances.

As a result, they take taxpayer's money away from those who are lawfully entitled to use these services and put a burden on the state. Moreover, illegal immigrants undercut the labour market by accepting low wages and working under illegal conditions.

        "content": "It's a great idea but in practice how would it work? Taking them out of the shops will leave greater problems since many people smoke because they are addicted and not because they enjoy it. Making something illegal is of course easier than it seems. We must weigh in not only the reasons why, but also how are we going to implement a certain set of provision. We have to realise that making something illegal does not automatically solve a problem, instead it might create even more problems as a repercussion to such a decision. Making illicit drugs such as heroine, cocaine, etc. was agreeably a good decision. However, the consequences of making such commendable decisions also involve the allocation of large amounts of state resources (read: tax payer money) to combat illegal drug trafficking. Apparently, making these drugs illegal did not really stop people from using the drugs (fyi: drugs are still a lucrative business, if not why would people risk their lives to smuggle it). That said, the same goes for cigarettes, I don't see any strong reason that making cigarettes (or smoking them) illegal to be of any use in the context of making people quit the bad habit. People who smoke are addicted to it, and as those people who are addicted to illicit drugs, they will always find ways to circumvent the law. Making smoking illegal does not automatically make the business less profitable. As I see it, the demand for cigarettes are still high everywhere, and this kind of policy would only create \"black markets\" for the item. This in turn would put burden on the law enforcement to combat such black markets (read: more personnel, more funds needed), and of course these burdens would be passed on to tax payers who pays for all the cost of faithfully enforcing such a new law. I believe that the restrictions and requirements which are already in place (i.e. restricting smoking areas, limited advertisement methods) are sufficient enough to tackle the problem. Moreover, the current approach is right on track where the government should sponsor and support policies that would decrease the demand for cigarettes (if the demand for cigarettes were to fall substantially, the business would be less lucrative, and soon enough nobody will be in the cigarette business). This is not a policy that would effectively reduce the demand, simply making it illegal is not addressing to the demand problem.Thus, what I see in this is another burden for the state budget, with little or minimal impact on the real issue at hand.",

Everyone should be entitled their own freedom of speech, and making it illegal to swear takes away from this. Even though swearing is rude, trashy and a sin people should be entitled and be able to say things they want to, but only if it's not harassing and bullying. Almost everyone swears if something goes wrong, they get hurt, or something just happens and a little swear words pops out, and if we put a law against this i think a lot of drama would happen, when you discuss this topic.

We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs.

A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet.

Yet, in the hands of a woman (Ursula), it is unequivocally evil and wreaks havoc in the order of the natural world, as expressed through the storm she conjures. Even female protagonists with magical powers like Rapunzel and Elsa are considered dangerous and locked away. Disney sends young women a clear message: females should only earn power through beauty.",

A study by Gunasekera, H. et al titled  “Sex and Drugs in Popular Movies: an Analysis of the Top 200 Films”  found that smoking was portrayed in 68% of the films and that they “...tended to portray their use positively and without negative consequences.” This normalization of smoking is hindering the effort to try and stop people taking up smoking, by regularly seeing the activity young people will consider the activity socially acceptable which gives the wrong message needed to help stop the activity and minimize health related problems from it. While films are most often fictional and produced for the purpose of entertainment people still do learn, whether rightly or wrongly, from them, it is arguably socially and morally irresponsible then for directors and films studios alike to show smoking in films without clearly demonstrating the negative side to it as it is painting an incorrect representation of what it is to be a smoker.",

Aladdin takes us to ancient Iraq, Mulan takes us to China, and Pocahontas to the Colonial Americas. The only problem is, Disney has a penchant for stereotypes . The Jungle Book literally depicts African Americans as lazy, nonsensical monkeys, while Dumbo depicts them as lazy, nonsensical birds. Moana’s depiction of the demigod Maui as gigantic is considered among Polynesians as insensitive , considering that the obesity rate in the South Pacific is the highest in the world. And while many Disney movies are peppered with insensitive depictions of cultures, Arabs receive some of the worst treatment. The Phrygian opening song of Aladdin relates the “facts” of the Arab world that the audience is expected to accept: “ It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home .” Aladdin’s hero is a thief, its law enforcement filled with easily duped zealots, their Sultan imbecilic, and its villain an evil sorcerer. The film’s indiscernible mashup of Arab cultures and histories leads to an unflattering presentation of a people whose global legacy is much more than an enchanted lamp.",

This exploratory study examines how Disney animated films over the last eight decades portraited the presence of parents in the life of the child characters. The research question is: How do Disney animated films portray the main child character’s parents in the stories? This study found that Disney animated films historically have not focused on the entire family unit, mainly by not having the main child character’s parents present in the story."

This investigation sought to provide greater understanding of the predominant messages children receive about the general representation, structure, and function of families within Disney animated films from 1937 to 2018. However, nuclear family portrayals within Disney animated films were less often depicted in comparison to other forms of children’s media.

A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine links being a self-proclaimed binge-watcher with a 98% amplified risk of poor sleep quality, including fatigue and insomnia, which can lead to secondary side effects (depression, increased tendencies for sedentary habits, etc.). In the moment it may seem like a good idea but binge-watching before bed can make the next day a difficult one to get through. A recent survey shows that 88% of US adults and 95% of 14 to 44-year-olds have lost sleep because of staying up late to binge-watch multiple episodes of a TV show or streaming series. Binge-watching doesn’t only impact your sleep. A Scottish study from the University of Glasgow asserts that watching more than 2 hours and 12 minutes of television a day is not only bad for your mental and physical health but can actually lead to an early death. Spending long periods sitting in one place can slow your metabolism and contribute to developing potentially fatal blood clots. Not to mention that binge-watching may lead to binge-eating.

Binge-watching, by contrast, doesn’t provide the time needed for after-thoughts and discussions, central to the community-building experience. Viewer discussions around mystery or action TV shows, like “Did Daenerys Targaryen really have to destroy Kings Landing?” or “Did Tony Soprano live or die?” are less likely to happen when the mystery is solved or reasoning explained minutes after the question was posed. Additionally, the binge-watching phenomenon attests to the lack of patience that characterizes modern society. We’re used to getting everything immediately and aren’t good at waiting for things we want. Our need for instant gratification (and our inability to delay gratification) may not be good for people over time, and binge-watching is a major example of this problem.",

Music and movies are not affected by the personal opinions or even the actions of their creators.

He went on to star in six more James Bond movies, cementing how we think of the on-screen character.

And that’s okay. You don’t have to love a play just because lots of other people do.

People generally speaking have a basic respect for privacy. While some people may think their politicians owe them a special duty and thus have to give up certain privileges like privacy, the covenant between citizen and representative cannot be justified on such stringent grounds. A politician is effectively an employee of his constituents and the citizens of the polity. If this was justification for scrutiny into the private lives of elected officials then why should it not also be justification for intrusion into the private lives of unelected civil servants? Both these groups are doing a job for the public, but undertraining this job does not give the public the authority to intrude into their privacy beyond questions about whether they are qualified for the job. The duty of an elected politician is not so special as to demand an abrogation of his or her ability to enjoy a private life.

The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours.

They may not want to become part of a media-driven narrative, and certainly not to become symbols for a new social crusade to reform communities. Removing violent reporting removes these perverse incentives to irritate victims and families, and instead leads to more respectful and considerate treatment. As for those accused of crimes, it can be hard for someone acquitted after a trial or accusation to get on with life. Some people may find themselves roundly accused by the media and public, even portrayed as monster, making it very hard to move on, even when their names are officially cleared. This is completely contrary to how the legal system should function, where acquittal is meant to deliver absolution. Allowing the media to construct narratives of guilt in the absence of evidence undermines the very fabric of justice. The media’s incessant coverage of violent crimes and its alacrity to make accusations and jump to conclusions can destroy someone’s life, more than even having to stand trial does. Justice must prevail and be fair to those to whom it judges in court, and this can only be done by not allowing the media to turn the mob against people even after their names are cleared.",

But the problem is that once you start to build an audience based on outrage and anger, as MSNBC and CNN are both doing in the age of Trump, you risk tumbling down a slippery slope, which is exactly what happened to Fox News. It’s alarming because in many ways Fox and MSNBC have walked right into Trump’s trap when he says the press is “the enemy of the people.” They’ve built up their audiences based on anger or support for Trump, and now they’re attached to it."

Standardized tests have been a staple in U.S. education since the mid-1800s, providing a consistent way to measure student achievement. Here’s what standardized testing can do:. By having all learners take the same standardized assessment — regardless of their school or district — school leaders can easily compare student test scores across diverse backgrounds. Standardized tests can highlight achievement gaps between student groups, like those from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Savvy students can often guess answers on standardized tests based on familiar patterns or questions they already know. Standardized tests can undermine the confidence of previously successful students. Nevertheless, these tests help educators pinpoint learning gaps by comparing student knowledge."

As we can see, it hasn't happened - and in fact the opposite idea is now prevalent. The current climate change scare is just a repeat of the 1970s. Furthermore, does anyone remember chlorofluorocarbons? Those really did damage the environment: most notably the ozone layer. The papers were flooded with the idea that the ozone layer would be stripped away irreparably and we had well and truly destroyed our own planet. Except that it's now closing.

After being accused of sexual harassment by three different women, two of whom were former aides, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was criticized for his apology because it focused more on his alleged actions having been misinterpreted instead of the alleged actions themselves. This can make it seem like the public apology has turned into an appeal for sympathy. Take, for instance, Kevin Spacey’s statement in 2017 addressing allegations that he molested then-14-year-old actor Anthony Rapp. His non-apology opened by claiming not to remember the incident, distancing himself off the bat. He closed with the revelation that he is now committed to living a homosexual lifestyle. This patronizing and narcissistic statement attempts to transform outrage into pride and almost asks us to consider him brave. Not to mention the harm his statement caused to the LGBTQ community, who have been fighting the stigma of pedophilia for decades. Disingenuous apologies that read as excuses are merely excuses.",

For some of these victims, feelings of loss of control and self are all common symptoms of trauma. Recovery can take a lifetime, but a public apology has the potential to diffuse the feelings of helplessness caused by sexual assault trauma and provide closure.

These values include public health - required immunizations not only have concrete benefits but also teach children that their actions have consequences on the greater whole. We believe that parents that teach their own children have less of incentive to immunize children and statistically do not. Public schooling gives a voice to the government that speaks of the societal values that have been agreed on by the general public. We believe that both society and the government have a right to influence the child's development, not only because the government plays a part in protecting the child, but because of the important role the future adult will play as a citizen of society. We believe that public schooling is the mouthpiece for the interests of both the government and society as a whole. Naturally, parents will have the right to influence the development of the child, but homeschooling allows parents to become sole dictators of the child's progress, which is harmful. While some parents' 'curriculum' may be aligned with that of the public, there are no safeguards against parents that may indoctrinate their kids with beliefs that will raise them to become harmful citizens. These beliefs can include gross intolerance for particular minority groups supported by false information. These ideas can still reach the child outside of school, but the government has a duty to protect children from a regressive upbringing by at least offering a more constructive perspective. The cost of not ensuring that the next generation has the foundation of accepted principals and values of the society in them outweighs the potential benefits of homeschooling.",

A democratic system is best served when it encourages the participation of candidates from a range of backgrounds and professional fields. The ability of a government to arrive at novel solutions to problems confronting a state, to understand that state’s economy and to effectively represent different sectors of the population will be compromised without a diverse skillset within the state’s legislative and executive branches.

One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.",

Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.",

As the St. Louis Business Journal points out, many small restaurant owners don’t have the ability to effectively and efficiently reformulate their menu items. So banning trans fat could mean that your favorite independently-owned fried chicken joint down the street will be shuttering its doors.”(17) Consequently, a trans-fat ban would breed legal exceptions and inconsistencies. For example, in Illinois bakeries were exempted from their ban because lawmakers knew that it would drive up their costs and hurt the bakeries specialty items. Many other small businesses would be similarly affected Restaurants and other specialty vendors who use trans-fat products on site would also be affected. Lawmakers then have a choice of either reducing the effect of the ban and including lots of bureaucratic exemptions or punishing these businesses.",

Admittedly, parents in our world aren’t always what we wish them to be, but we insist that they do more harm than good. The Prop has denied the immense risks associated with abortion, which stretch from acute hematometra (post-abortal syndrome) to breast cancer, infertility, and increased risk for clinical depression and suicide. The suicide rate is nearly six times greater among aborting women than among women who give birth. These findings refute the oft-heard claim that induced abortion is safer than childbirth.” The myth that childbirth is more risky than abortion is largely based on the way that statistics about abortion-related deaths are collected: such deaths are often attributed to present problems. These are risks that parents have a right and a responsibility to evaluate for their minor children, who are by law as well as by custom the responsibility of parents. So why should abortions need consent when a decision to keep the child doesn’t? Quite simply, the nature of pregnancy in most cases necessitates parental involvement, since it is rarely kept a secret, and almost always requires emotional and material support. The law need not step in where immediacy does. In truth, each of the options, including abortion, carry with them serious and long-term risks that need to be not only carefully considered, but offset with the kind of support a parent is best able to give.",

If a teenage driver gets into a car accident, it is the parents that are responsible for paying for the damage. The law in this case recognizes that the child should not be responsible. The decision to have an abortion is a serious one, as the Proposition has already agreed. Parents have a role in society to protect their children from dangers and things that may harm them. If we as a global society require parents to take responsibility, we need to ensure that they have a corresponding right to the information that will allow them to act. Having an abortion is a surgical procedure. If a child were having his tonsils out, the hospital would require a signed form from the parents giving them permission to perform the surgery. An abortion is no different. There are always risks with medical procedures and parents have a right to know what is happening with their child. The decision whether or not to terminate the pregnancy does not only affect the mother. If she decides not to keep the baby, whether it is through abortion or adoption, the emotional ramifications of that decision will affect the parents as the teen experiences them. If the teen decides to keep the child, the parents are affected in more ways than one. They will likely be the ones that are responsible for supporting the baby financially as most teenage mothers are unemployed. They will also be responsible for the care of the child during school hours while the teen is attending classes. The majority of society expects no less of them.

The Prop states that teens with understanding families do consult them over a pregnancy. We maintain that many of them are not. Many teens have no idea how their parents will respond to such a scenario, and unable to think rationally about the possibilities. The big problem is not parents who are against abortion, but teens who refuse to consult even supportive parents because they fear disappointing them. This is why they need to be pushed to consult their parents. We concede that there exists a problem with parents who fail to concern themselves with their children's well-being, however, these compose only a minority, and exceptions can easily be accommodated by the law. In fact, there are plenty of conservative folks who do begin to see things in a different light when it touches them. The problem here is that children, faced with pregnancy, are likely to withdraw rather than reach out and access parental support.

Thomson maintains that whether a woman has a moral obligation to allow a fetus to remain in her body is a separate question from whether the fetus is a person with a right to life, and depends instead on the amount of sacrifice or burden it imposes on her. Instead of “repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*“, the Court could simply have rejected viability as the point at which the state’s interest in protecting potential life outweighed the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, and upheld Mississippi’s right to ban abortions after 15 weeks."

There is a massive difference in the way that we treat sentient and non-sentient beings instinctively.

Here we are talking about something more than sentimentality but rather the kind of relationship in which one is concerned with the other party’s emotional wellbeing. We even feel concerned about the wellbeing of sentient beings which whom we do not have a personal connection. For example we may feel upset when we see a dog run over on the road. This would be a very difficult reaction to how we might feel if we see an object crushed by a car. We feel moral outrage at the clubbing of seals. The instinctive way which we differentiate between these two categories relates to the type of value they have. Whilst objects have value because of how they affect us - e.g. they are useful or remind us of a good time or person – we believe that animals have intrinsic value.

        "content": "According to the Geneva convention the principle of proportionality states that harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated in an attack on a military objective. Military objective is defined are defined to be those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage . When a state is in conflict with a non-state actor we think that a legitimate military objective is the capture (extraterriotorial if neccessary) of combatants of that non-state actor. In the case of terrorist networks individuals can bare a lot of power. There are terrorist ''king-pins'', who control and moralize other terrorists and are in possession of important information about the network. The capture of these individuals can be a blow to the terrorist organization, because it loses an experienced member who can train others and demoralizes the organization. Of course it also disarms this individual and limits his capacity to threaten the state further. With this we establish that there is a definite military advantage in the capture of such individuals. But is it proportional to the damage done to civilians? To justify the proportionality of extra-territorial rendition we have to look at what kind of damage it can bring to the civilian population of other states. The proposition has brought out that sometimes innocent individuals will be captured. Against this we argue that during the course of the trial the innocence or guilt of the captured individuals has to emerge. When it is established that the individual was indeed innocent the damage done to that person can be reversed by returning him to his home state. If however the individual is guilty, his capture would have potentially lead to the saving of lives of many civilians and thus is a proportional act. For proportional response to ever be applied, it is required that a country should have access to the entire spectrum of possible responses. Otherwise, it is impossible to select the response which matches the cause with the required severity. When options are taken from the table, what happens? Inevitably, a country will be left between two options, one which is less severe than that required, and one which is more severe. Even if we assume the country has mercy in its soul, and opts for the less response, the lack of proportionality will mean that it will not have fully served its purpose in cutting off the threat which provoked it, thereby making it less effective than the response that direct proportionality requires. Unfortunately, even this best case scenario is unlikely to happen. Countries are less sensitive to foreign deaths than those of their own citizens. Therefore, the path most chosen is likely to be that of greater than proportional vengeance, and therefore greater than proportional bloodshed. The importance of allowing small scale solutions to small scale problems is one widely recognised, at least implicitly, by modern nation states. Most nation states operate intelligence agencies, and many of these conduct operations overseas, often without the knowledge of local governments. And yet, the operations of these agents, who are the agents of a foreign state, and often involve the collection of sensitive information, or materials, is not, and is unlikely to ever be, considered a warcrime. The reason, is because without these small scale, surgical instruments at hand, states would have only far heavier tools for dismantling threats to their existence. In the case of extroardinary rendition. Certainly, there are some scenarios when a suspect would simply be left alone. But is it to be expected that any government would simply allow an individual who is plotting the murder of its citizens to continue unobstructed? Far more likely for goverrnments to take more drastic measures, from openly declared strikes and incursions, to placing economic, military, or political pressure on state leaders to permit the extradition and interrogation of their suspect. Both alternatives are far more damaging to long term political relations between the countries, and far less likely to be effective in stemming the short term problem. War crimes law should be designed to defuse conflict, not incite it.",

In clinical practice, the diagnostic rules allow a patient to be diagnosed with ADHD if they have most of the symptoms that cause distress, impairment or both, even when they don’t meet the full criteria.

Following changes that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, patients and clinicians might be asking more questions as a result.

Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12.

Many agree that complete lack of regulation is no longer desirable. Equally, however, excessive government regulation in any part of the economy could yet backfire. How can the best of both worlds - free marketeering and government regulation - be ensured? Through smart policies like ours. A benefit of our policy is that it is an illustration of how to get the mix between regulation and hands-off liberalism, correct. Our policy is based on the ideological conviction that the state has a political and ethical mandate to ensure that social disasters, like economic recessions, are either avoided, or that steps are taken to minimise the impact of recessions that do arise. Given that our mechanism, as already proven, is an effective tool for minimising the possibility, and certainly the impact, of a banking crisis - it is therefore a policy that exhibits responsible government. Yet, at the same time, the policy falls short of being unduly, and unacceptably, prescriptive. Banks are still left with a fundamental capacity to make autonomous economic decisions within the reasonable constraint imposed by our policy. Thus our policy is consistent with economic freedom, and the recognition of the importance of allowing economic agents, banks included, the space to play freely with each other - ensuring the textbook benefits of economic liberalism, but with a safety valve necessitated, ultimately, by our inherent human capacity to be self-destructively imprudent.

Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

If you regularly spend time away from the baby, use a breast pump during your absence at the same frequency the baby would feed to maintain your milk supply. Breastfeeding has multiple benefits for you and your baby. Supplementing with formula will cause your baby to nurse less and further reduce your milk supply. After breastfeeding is established, you can allow family members to bottle-feed the baby expressed milk. If breastfeeding is not the best choice for you and your baby, iron-fortified commercially available formula is the next best option. Formula feeding is convenient and offers greater flexibility than breastfeeding. Formula is less digestible than breastmilk, resulting in your baby staying full longer and needing less frequent feedings. While breastfeeding is best, many loving parents choose formula feeding for personal, valid reasons and raise healthy babies."

And I think about how I’m going to look at my wife when I get back home, and how she’ll know I’m seeing her — really seeing her — for the first time all over again. It’s probably too much to say that my ego was gone — I don’t think it works like that. People say that a single ayahuasca trip is like a decade of therapy packed into a night. I keep thinking about this idea that a night of ayahuasca is like a decade of therapy.

Interestingly, the *why* of Ayahuasca use seemed to play a role in the kind and severity of mental health side effects: People whose cultural or spiritual practices involved Ayahuasca use had notably fewer negative experiences than people who used it in an uncontrolled or recreational context. That risk is higher for people using Ayahuasca in concert with other substances and for individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, psychosis, mania and related mental health symptoms. If you’re familiar with Ayahuasca, you may have heard that researchers think it has the potential to help with a wide range of mental health conditions, like substance-use disorder (SUD), substance withdrawal, eating disorders, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

Without this principle, the medical profession would lose a great deal of trust; and admitting that killing is an acceptable part of a doctor’s role would likely increase the danger of involuntary euthanasia, not reduce it. Legalising assisted suicide also places an unreasonable burden on doctors. The daily decisions made in order to preserve life can be difficult enough; to require them to also carry the immense moral responsibility of deciding who can and cannot die, and the further responsibility of actually killing patients, is unacceptable. This is why the vast majority of medical professionals oppose the legalisation of assisted suicide: ending the life of a patient goes against all they stand for. The Hippocratic Oath that doctors use as a guide states 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.'",

The degree to which physical pain and psychological distress can be tolerated is different in all humans. Quality of life judgements are private and personal, thus only the sufferer can make relevant decisions. People are given a large degree of autonomy within their lives and since deciding to end your life does not physically harm anyone else, it should be within your rights to decide when you wish to die. While the act of suicide does remove option to choose life, most cases in which physician assisted suicide is reasonable, death is the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process. The choice for the patient, therefore, is not to die, but to cease suffering and tto chose the time and manner of their death.",

The law cannot adapt to the specificity and multitude of ethical problems that arise on a situational basis. The law can only take into account circumstances that it foresees and can elaborate on. The highly personal and situational nature of this issue deems it insufficient for legislation, which exists outside the realm of the personal. The foundation of medical ethics relies upon the understanding of the consent (when applicable) of the patient to the procedure and the discretion, judgment, and experience of the medical profession to whom the patient has entrusted their care.

Neither of these issues arise with either assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia.

However, if an individual accepts that death is their preferred option in such a scenario, it is difficult to comprehend of reasons why they should not be allowed to proceed. Our social rejection of murder does not, ultimately relate to death itself but to the denial of choice. With murder someone is denying that person all their future potential so denying their freedom of choice, and this remains the case even if the murder was completely painless. Here, reason tells us, the virtuous act is death and the reservation of that choice. The determining element of humanity is that we are rational beings; a blanket ban – legal and social – on choosing the time and manner of our deaths reflects our primeval fear of a death that comes, unwanted, in the dark of the night, not the mature judgement of modern, thinking (and long-lived) humans.

People, particularly when in desperate situations, tend to overestimate a treatment’s efficacy. Given that these treatments are still undergoing the trial process, it is possible that they are ineffective, or have side-effects that outweigh any benefits. Thus, to allow such drugs and treatments to be handed out during the testing process, there is a great risk of giving people false hope. This is especially the case given the compromised role of the physician in this scenario: ordinarily, if a patient wants an experimental drug, they can have a discussion with their physician that stresses the ‘in trial’ nature of the drug, and thus the uncertainty of it working. Subsequent experiences (the inconveniences of trials; filling in forms and receiving expenses) reinforce the idea that these drugs were experimental, and that the bulk of the benefit from the trial accrues for future patients. Consequently, in that scenario it is easier for the physician to help the patient to come to terms with the end of life; to deal with this and to realise that any trial drugs give only a slim chance of improvement. In the scenario envisaged by this proposition, experimental drugs can be acquired as easily as licensed ones, and therefore there is no longer that clear distinction for the patient between ‘doing all you can’ in the ordinary sense, (trying every treatment that is known to be effective) and trying ‘one more (experimental) drug’. Therefore, the patient is less likely to be able to come to terms with their own condition, and therefore less likely to be able to deal with the emotional trauma inflicted not only upon them, but on close family and loved ones.",

A 1995 study of Michigan oncologists revealed five factors that were important to physicians when considering the approval or disapproval of PAS: global attitudes toward PAS (including ideas like “Does a patient have a right to end his or her life if he or she has an incurable disease,” and “Oncologists should have the right to help a patient commit suicide by medical means”), attitudes toward the acceptability of withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining therapies, philosophical prohibitions toward PAS, concerns of legal consequences of PAS, and beliefs that PAS could be avoided with better end-of-life care [12]. When asked about current practices of PAS in states where it is legal, only 24% of physicians disagreed (49% agree; 26% neutral) that the most common reason for patients seeking PAS is physical pain (Table 4)."

However, being burdened by homework , which stops them from doing fun activities, may make them feel negative emotions towards schoolwork.

Many elementary students also feel that their homework is just “busy work” or that the teacher “has” to assign it, so they don’t take it seriously . Even worse is when homework is beyond a child’s ability and becomes work for the parents . This can lead to resentment in some parents who feel forced to complete their child’s projects – not to mention frustration on the part of the child, who feels he or she can’t do the homework without help.",

More recently, more recently, 65% of parents said that homework-related stress negatively impacted their families. Homework stress may affect students’ health by causing headaches and stomach problems. Some children experience sleep deprivation by staying up too late to finish their homework. This is harmful to both kids’ health and their learning abilities, as sleep has been shown to help with memory consolidation .

These findings suggest that capital punishment may not actually be a deterrent for crime. The winds may be shifting regarding the public’s opinion about the death penalty. This is evident by the recent decision of a non-unanimous Florida jury to sentence the Parkland High School shooter to life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty .

        "content": "The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1. In short, the death penalty can- and does- save the lives of innocent people. \"The Death Penalty Deters Crime and Saves Lives,\" August 28,2007.

The proposition has not proven that extraterritorial rendition always inevitably leads to torture. They are making a convincing case against torture, but this is not what this debate should be about. So our claim stands: if extraterritorial rendition can be done without leading to torture, then it is not a war crime. The article we cite and the proposition also quote implies in its conclusion that extraterritorial abductions are necessary and inevitable. It specifically says that there needs to be a legal framework that determines when and how these abductions can be done. The proposition implies that this article does not agree with our position, but they have not shown how that is, where we have shown how it supports our case.

If these people are right, cases in which torture might be morally justified by the same types of consideration that can justify killing in self-defense will be very rare. If, after taking into account the effect that engaging in torture might have on general respect for the law that for-bids it, a person still has good reason to believe that morality requires that he engage in torture, because the person to be tortured is clearly liable and the torture would be a necessary and proportionate means of defending the innocent, then I think that person ought morally to engage in torture."

Decades-long studies have shown that this fear was unfounded. Adopted children who interact with their birth families feel integrated into their adoptive families and regard their adoptive parents as their mother and father. In some cases, the possibility of forming some kind of relationship with their birth family may create a sense of an “extended family” and, thus, mitigates adoptees’ yearning to search for their roots. Whereas closed adoptions have been shown to promote birth-family fantasies in children and adolescents, an adoptee’s interaction with biological family helps the placed child develop a realistic idea of their birth family, and thereby form a more authentic and positive self-identity as an adopted person",

Also let us not forget future children who contract the disease while in the uterus. So it is in countries where prostitution is illegal where we can’t keep sex workers safe from AIDS. In these countries prostitutes aren’t even allowed to be prostitutes. They tend to enter the profession because they have no other way of earning money or they may be forced to do it. On the other hand, if prostitution is legal and regulations are put in place, sex workers will be safer from STI’s and HIV/AIDS. Regular health checks will pick up any possible infections and there will be laws to protect the well-being of sex workers. What’s more, these laws will not only protect sex workers, but their clients too.

It is perfectly possible for a Government to provide an education program and legalise prostitution at the same time, in fact that is what is done in places like New Zealand where prostitution is legal and we provide sex education in schools. In fact, legalising prostitution actually helps a wider education program. If the opp wants people to be properly educated about AIDS, then they should not want to exclude and stigmatise sex workers. If you continue to ban prostitution, then it actually entrenches the idea that prostitutes are somehow lesser people whose welfare we shouldn't care about when it comes to HIV. As it is, countries that ban prostitution make no effort to protect prostitutes at all. To have a free and open discussion, it is necessary to allow a free discussion about prostitution, which can only happen if it is legal. If it is not, it is much more difficult to acquire information about prostitutes and about the conditions in which they work, because they are less willing to come forward and admit to what they are doing. The opp has conceded that there is a problem of people having unsafe sex with prostitutes, and yet it seems like the only group of people they want to exclude from their education program are the prostitutes themselves. If we can identify who the prostitutes are, then we can educate them. If prostitution is illegal and forced underground, we can't provide them with info. In addition, we can't provide information with people who use prostitutes, both because they won't admit to committing an illegal act and because banning prostitution increases the stigma on these people. The prop has missed the point entirely when they say we will be unable to enforce regulation, because it will be in the interests of the prostitutes and brothels to abide by regulations and report those who don't.",

In a 5-country study on sex trafficking, most of the trafficked and prostituted women interviewed in the Philippines, Venezuela and the United States (3) strongly stated their opinion that prostitution should not be legalized and considered legitimate work, warning that legalization would create more risks and harm for women from already violent customer and pimps (Raymond et al, 2002)."

Not only does sex work become safer when it is regulated, but legalization also works to weed out the black market that exists for prostitution, thereby making women safer overall. The underlying reason that people are uncomfortable listening to sex workers about legalizing prostitution has nothing to do with concern for the health and safety of women. The underlying reason people disagree with legalizing prostitution is that prostitution is viewed as amoral because it involves (mostly) women selling their bodies for financial gain. What is disingenuous is opposing legalized sex work for reasons that purport to be women’s safety, but that are actually coming from a place of discomfort over women openly engaging in sexual interactions for financial gain."

By contrast, numerous studies have shown that decriminalizing prostitution would bring the industry into the realm of law, redirect attention from prosecuting commercial sex to prosecuting the crimes that are the actual causes of the harm, which could prevent sex trafficking, violence, and other kinds of danger. Since the selling or buying of sex services is an action between two individuals with mutual consent, taking place in a private space and having no foreseeable impact on other parties, the state should not have the right to prohibit the action under criminal law, independent of morality. If prostitution is decriminalized and becomes taxable income, the extra government revenue could be used to provide health care benefits for sex workers to ensure their mental and physical health, fund programs to eliminate human trafficking, and set up departments for regulating and standardizing the industry."

The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms. Similarly, the Court in dicta stated that firearm regulations would not implicate the Second Amendment if that weaponry cannot be used for law-abiding purposes. *Kachalsky v County of Westchester*, 701 F.3d 81 (2nd Cir. 2012) (holding that a New York law preventing individuals from obtaining a license to possess a concealed firearm in public for general purposes unless the individual showed proper cause did not violate the Second Amendment)."

A single-celled organism called *Chromosphaera perkinsii* appears to possess a embryonic process similar to animal mitosis, even though the organism separated from animal’s evolutionary line a billion years ago. * While this similar process suggests that animals inherited their own version of the ability from their single-celled ancestors, scientists can’t rule out the possibility that this could be another case of convergent evolution. However, scientists from Switzerland and the U.S. have discovered that this animal contained genetic instructions from embryonic development, meaning that the eggs existed even before life itself. “This paper gets at the core question of developmental biology, which is how we go from one cell to a whole animal, by looking at a related process in a weird, microbial relative to animals,” John Burns, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory in Maine said in a press statement."

More and more research has come to light that shows long-term benefits of paternity leave for fathers, children and families.

Paid maternity leave has been found to lower the risks of post-partum depression.

After the effects, side effects and more complex interactions of a drug have been confirmed using animal and non-animal testing, it will usually pass to what is called a phase I clinical trial - tests on human volunteers to confirm how the drug will interact with human physiology and what dosages it should be administered in. The risk of a human volunteer involved in a phase I trial being harmed is extremely small, but only because animal tests, along with non-animal screening methods are a highly effective way of ensuring that dangerous novel drugs are not administered to humans. In the United Kingdom, over the past twenty years or more, there have been no human deaths as a result of phase I clinical trials. Novel compounds (as opposed to so-called \"me-too\" drugs, that make slight changes to an existing treatment) are the substances that hold the most promise for improving human lives and treating previously incurable conditions. However, their novelty is also the reason why it is difficult for scientists to predict whether they may cause harm to humans. Research into novel compounds would not be possible without either animal testing, or tremendous risk to human subjects, with inevitable suffering and death on the part of the trial volunteers on some occasions. It is difficult to believe that in such circumstances anyone would volunteer, and that even if they did, pharmaceutical companies would be willing to risk the potential legal consequences of administering a substance to them they knew relatively little about.

This paper employs the insights of French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, to explore the persistence of animal research within academia. Several of Bourdieu’s concepts are applied, including field and habitus, but perhaps it is his concept of capital that is most valuable in this context, providing a valuable shorthand for discussing the system of rewards and penalties within academia, clarifying how animal research converts into symbolic as well as social and economic capital and elucidating what scientists risk if they attempt to transition from animal research to NAMs. Bourdieu reminds us to attend to power relationships, particularly the relationship between the animal research field and the field of power."

It’s also been said that he have burned or destroyed many of papers and case notes over the years, so proof is elusive. In addition, it’s known that Freud didn’t welcome criticism or discussion. For example, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung was banished from professional circles after he dared to question Freud, who saw himself as the only authority on psychoanalysis, thereby limiting what could have led to expanded discussion and discoveries of other thought leaders of the time.

Freud’s focus on sexual explanations for psychological incidents has been seen as simplistic.

Experts at that time resorted to hypnosis or dubious treatments that included static electricity or bloodletting, among others. Drugs were also used, but more to subdue patients rather than treat them. The overriding conclusion pre-Freud was that mental illness was a result of physical impairment to the brain. His pioneering ideas sought to look deep into the human psyche and seek insights into the sources of people’s emotional conflicts. In so doing, he transformed people’s understanding of human behavior, especially with regard to treating mental disorders instead of just (mis)classifying them.

Teaching about the Holocaust is important to make students aware that under the “right” circumstances, anyone can get caught up in allowing violent crimes to be committed or even committing them themselves for what are perceived as the right reasons. The relevance of this Holocaust lesson was demonstrated by the post-Holocaust Milgram experiments . Participants were brought into a lab and told to administer electric shocks to a person in another room, should that person answer questions from a “memory test” incorrectly. Sixty-five percent of the participants continued to give shocks up to the highest, deadly level of 450 volts because the head of the experiment told them to keep going. In other words, these experiments showed how humans are conditioned to obey authority , to the extent that they would kill another person if told to do so. The Holocaust is a crucial, illustrative lesson on how almost anyone can be engulfed in and justify violent racism; this lesson must be taught to impressionable schoolchildren to prevent it from happening again.",

Suppose we do go to Mars, he says, and find living organisms in the subsurface that are DNA based, like life on Earth. The Clipper likely wouldn't be able to find life on Europa, but it could help make the case for a follow-up lander that could dig into the surface, studying its chemistry the way rovers have studied Mars's."

NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and scheduled to launch no later than May 2027), could zero in on a distant planet’s reflected light to detect the signatures of oxygen, water vapor, or some other powerful indication of possible life.

Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

The effect of a robbery on the physical health and psychological stability of an elderly person can be as pronounced as the effects of a violent assault on a healthy young man. It is disingenuous to claim that the nature of a criminal act can be separated from that act’s effects on a victim. As the widely known common law maxim states, a victim should be taken as he is found. A reasonable adult citizen will not be excused from responsibility for what he knew to be a harmful criminal act simply because he did not foresee the extent or type of harm he would do. A judicial system that takes the concept of proportionality seriously should be free to decide that the consequences of a robbery committed against an impoverished, frail widow should result in a more severe sentence than a teenager’s impulsive attempt to shop-lift alcohol. Similarly, the outcome of a wide ranging financial fraud is likely to be more harmful than the outcome of a fist fight between two drunken football fans.

There is no point to dehumanize, create distance, and tell others to see people as monsters if human beings are, in fact, naturally violent. But as Temple University psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein said, “when we don’t have wars, we call it the ‘interwar years.’ It’s a matter of selective reporting.” Or Kohn, yet again: “It is difficult to reconcile a theory of innate human aggressiveness with the simple fact that most people around us seem quite peaceful.”.

We don't think that anybody should suffer to that extent and this is why people should be allowed to counter this sort of damage by entering into pre-nups. Lengthy divorce battles may not always produce fair outcomes. The person who is more prone stress, will at some point no doubt feel that s/he will do whatever only to end the nightmare of courts. This may entice him to give ground on certain matters, for example relinquish some of his property, only to reach a settlement faster. This outcome may not be fair, because the person is acting under the duress. Pre-nuptial agreements present a fairer distribution of resources, because they have been signed voluntarily by both parties without pressure.",

During wedding ceremonies, couples pledge to remain together, “as long as we both shall live.” Divorce devalues the meaning of these vows – and consequently of the entire institution of marriage. This devaluation promotes an overall casual attitude towards marriage , leading people to enter marriages lightly and without due consideration; they know they can always obtain a divorce if the marriage doesn’t work out instead of fighting for the survival of the relationship.",

Marriage researchers have found that women’s household income will typically fall by 41% following a divorce or separation after age 50. In contrast, men’s household income only drops by 23%. Fathers typically must pay child support and, in some cases, alimony as well. Less than half of custodial parents who were supposed to receive full child support payments receive what they are owed. This leads many divorced parents to fall into poverty, as they must also cut back on work hours to provide after school care for their children. When there is only a single parent left with the children at a given time, it can be difficult for that parent to hold a full-time job and earn a decent living.",

When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

It’s not surprising, then, that, today, 81% of Americans find divorce morally acceptable. Additionally, along with society’s increased awareness about issues surrounding gender identity , its tolerance for non-traditional relationships may have also expanded. In fact, more and more Americans are open to the concept of polyamorous relationships and 5% are even in consensual non-monogamous relationships.

When a #BlueLivesMatter hashtag was added to support policemen, it was used to oppose #BlackLivesMatter.” This was further shown in 2016 when 10,000 people protested in support Peter Liang, a Chinese-American policeman who was jailed for killing Akai Gurley, an unarmed Black man. Many of Liang’s supporters shouted, “All Lives Matter,” claiming that he was a scapegoat because he was not white and that he should not be jailed. However, Black activists pointed out that Liang was tried by a jury of his peers and deserved to be jailed for his actions. Using “All Lives Matter” to demand freedom for someone who was convicted of murdering an unarmed Black man is nothing more than demanding that white privilege be extended to all people of color except for Black Americans.",

While these incidents should be investigated and any impropriety addressed legally, financially, and organizationally, some people are using these incidents to question their own commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement. While unsolicited martyrs have become symbols of the Black Lives Matter movement, one key statistic drives it—Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be killed by police when they are unarmed and not attacking, and as in the case of Trayvon Martin, more likely to be profiled because of race. When it comes to addressing racism, some people tend to quickly forget what the Black Lives Matter movement is about."

This furthers the perception of the minority as being inferior, and removes their capacity to be treated as an equal in the workplace and prove themselves. This assumption is not only harmful to those minorities who did receive assistance from affirmative action, but also anyone of that minority group regardless of if they were hired using affirmative action because there is simply an assumption that they are less qualified and there because of the policy because the policy exists.

Animals too express some of these characteristics to some degree and thus animals too are worthy of moral consideration. However, animal lives and human lives are of unequal value. This is due to the fact that no animal possesses all of these characteristics to the same degree as the average human, or even comes particularly close. Thus any rights ascribed to animals should be truncated relative to the rights we ascribe to humans. To the extent to which causing some harm to animals brings great benefit to humans, we are morally justified in creating some moral harm, to achieve a far greater moral good.",

It is this assumption that entangles women in unrealistic standards that can often form into an unhealthy preoccupation with the body. Doctors and patients alike report the addictive nature of Botox treatments. Patients show up younger and younger for injections, complain more frequently about wrinkles, and, unsatisfied with their results, are more likely to seek more aggressive remedies to combat aging, including surgery. Aging women are not the only victims. Over one-third of girls report dissatisfaction with their bodies from age five.

Some proactive arguments for cellphone use include accelerated learning, access to digital content, and a communication tool to parents for student safety. Science teachers, business education teachers, and students who are interested in information technology (IT) may find researching the inner components of a cell phone interesting. Learning what’s inside of a cell phone can be a way for students to learn about the technology they use every day, and how it can be beneficial for communication and networking. This includes choosing specific educational content for students, designating device-free time in classrooms and at home, and modeling proper expectations and behavior for phone use. Managing cell phones in schools should be a priority to protect the learning environment for students. However, poor classroom management and a lack of specific rules and routines for cellphone use can be disastrous to student learning outcomes."

Michael Rich, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says that phones and school don’t mix: Students can’t meaningfully absorb information while also texting, scrolling, or watching YouTube videos. Pereira’s approach is to step back — and to ask whether a student who can’t resist the phone is a signal that the teacher needs to work harder on making a connection. “Two things I try to share with my new teachers are, one, why is that student on the phone? Mesfin Awoke Bekalu, a research scientist in the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Chan School, argues that more flexible classroom policies can create opportunities for teaching tech-literacy and self-regulation."

Student use of cell phones during an unfolding emergency can distract their attention from safety and emergency response directions being given by school staff. Therefore the use of cell phones by students and others in the immediate school community could potentially decrease, not increase, school safety during a crisis. Cell phone use, texting, and other outside communications by students during a crisis also expedites parental flocking to the school at a time when school and public safety officials may need parents to be away from the school site due to evacuations, emergency response, and/or other tactical or safety reasons."

Schools must carefully weigh the pros and cons when deciding how to handle cellphone use during the school day. ### Pros of cellphone use. One of the biggest benefits of cellphones is their ability to give students access to educational resources. ### Cons of cellphone use. Some students use their phones to cheat on tests or plagiarize work, which can go against school policies and harm their own learning. Schools may face legal risks if students misuse their phones or if privacy issues arise due to phone use in the classroom. Cellphones can be useful tools in schools, but they also bring risks. Schools need to find a balance, allowing students to use their phones in helpful ways while keeping distractions and problems under control."

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.",

As the St. Louis Business Journal points out, many small restaurant owners don’t have the ability to effectively and efficiently reformulate their menu items. So banning trans fat could mean that your favorite independently-owned fried chicken joint down the street will be shuttering its doors.”(17) Consequently, a trans-fat ban would breed legal exceptions and inconsistencies. For example, in Illinois bakeries were exempted from their ban because lawmakers knew that it would drive up their costs and hurt the bakeries specialty items. Many other small businesses would be similarly affected Restaurants and other specialty vendors who use trans-fat products on site would also be affected.

This way, objective results can be obtained, driving future upkeep. Otherwise, the tidying process would never be completed . This, in turn, creates a sense that the work is never-ending, which can lead to a subsequent lack of motivation. Sometimes, people need a new approach to tidying up to drive real change.

And given that most people are not entrepreneurs or business owners, this means that most people will spend the most of their waking day labouring for goals set to them by others, in partial processes subdivided and defined for them by others, all to create products and services which are only valuable to others, not to themselves ( Alienation,  1977). This commodification of the human body and mind can go so far that humans actually start selling themselves: free market proponents propose to legalize the selling of one’s own organs. When humans start selling themselves, they perceive no value in themselves anymore – all they see in themselves is an instrument to satisfy other people’s desires, a product to be packaged and sold. This becomes even more pronounced when we take into account that the free market exacerbates inequality: if someone is born into a poor family and can’t get out of it, it might seem the only way to get out of it, is to sell oneself. Thus, the proposal to legalize the selling of one’s own organs amounts to an ‘unconscionable choice’: a choice which is, given the circumstances, unreasonable to ask of someone.",

In this Q&A, adapted from the August 25 episode of Public Health On Call, Lindsay Smith Rogers talks with Johannes Thrul, PhD, MS, associate professor of Mental Health, about cannabis as medicine, potential risks involved with its use, and what research is showing about its safety and efficacy. **Do you think medicinal cannabis paved the way for legalization of recreational use?**. There are, unfortunately, a lot of people who develop a problematic use of cannabis. When we look at the public health landscape and the effect of legislation, in this case legalization, one of the big benefits is taking cannabis out of the underground illegal market. The evidence from states that have legalized it has not demonstrated that we might all of a sudden see an increase in psychosis or in cannabis use disorder."

In 1978, it was Auerbach’s vision that drove the Celtics to draft Larry Bird, who was still relatively unknown. He turned out to be one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen.

At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice.",

That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest.

The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored.

NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL.

In the proposed 1985 system, a replay official would have monitored the game feed from an in-stadium booth and initiated all reviews, reversing a call only with “indisputable visual evidence.”. Instant replay’s first regular season saw an average of 1.6 reviews per game. “My buddy, the instant replay guy,” Williams jokingly said after the game. Instant replay review was back in the NFL. Instant replay is an accepted part of the game,” said Atlanta Falcons general manager and Competition Committee Co-Chairman Rich McKay.

Arsenal not only rode the longest undefeated run in Premier League history (49 games, including an entire season without a loss), but did so in a stylish, eye-captivating way, with exciting soccer that is based on technique and short passing. Wenger pioneered Arsenal’s purist game philosophy. It still shapes the present team’s style of play. This adventurous gameplay should be appreciated, especially by those who love the beauty of soccer. Even when he is long gone, this way of playing will remain deeply embedded within the club.",

After a 2-page summary of Wenger’s statistics as a player (1969-1981), we get the league records and standings for each team Wenger managed, from his first season at Nancy (1984) to his last at Arsenal (2018), a summary of his accomplishments at Arsenal, a list of every player who appeared for Arsenal during Wenger’s tenure, and a list of the top ten transfer fees paid by Arsenal during his time. In some ways, *Wenger: My Life and Lessons in Red and White*is written particularly with Arsenal fans in mind, assuming they can fill in gaps in the narrative from memory while Wenger tries to mollify their disappointment at the club maintaining a top-four level without ever claiming a league championship during his last fourteen years managing Arsenal FC."

Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods are just a couple examples of professional athletes who are no longer seen as being role models for youngsters. Today, we know much more about our sports heroes’ lives, for better and for worse. This insight has contributed to the erosion of their status as heroes. As athletes’ statuses change, our attitudes toward them do as well. This has led to a growing public understanding and acceptance of athletes who use PEDs. Thus, our criteria for including baseball players in the National Baseball Hall of Fame has softened over the years , allowing for the inclusion of PED users. In fact, some voters don’t feel that they should be passing judgement on players who used PEDs when there are reportedly racists, gamblers and wife beaters in the Hall of Fame.",

Although college athletes are now allowed to profit from NIL contracts, they still cannot receive pay-to-play salaries from their schools. Many college athletes receive sports scholarships, which are meant to be a form of compensation for their work. Next, take a look at the arguments in favor of paying college athletes for their work — with the emphasis on the word “work.” Collegiate sports do indeed represent a considerable commitment of time and effort, often resembling a full-time job. If few college athletes receive scholarships and fewer still receive full scholarships, and considering that playing college sports can be equivalent to a full-time job, then an argument could indeed be made that college athletes should receive salaries for their work."

As Jon Solomon, Editorial Director for the Sports and Society Program at the Aspen Institute explained, “The most glaring example occurred when the University of North Carolina was found by outside parties to have organized fake classes that enabled dozens of athletes to gain and maintain their eligibility… of the 3,100 students who took the fake classes over 18 years, 47.4 percent were athletes… North Carolina avoided NCAA penalties by essentially arguing that the NCAA should stay out of irregularities in college courses.” The NCAA polices athletes’ finances but does not ensure a quality education.

While MMA fighters are more likely to get cuts and bruises, boxers have a higher chance of suffering from head trauma, one of the most dangerous injuries. In fact, the blood often seen in MMA is caused by blows to the nose or facial cuts, which tend to look much worse than they are. Unlike other athletes that compete very regularly, MMA fighters only get into the ring between one and five times year . Training happens in very safe conditions, making serious injury very unlikely. In comparison, football players play around 17 games a season. With the number of collisions and tackles in each game, their risk of a serious injury is much higher than in MMA.",

He was a freedom fighter who fought against racism . He also had unparalleled charisma and charm. He was a master of self-promotion and smart enough to know how to use the media for his purposes. This made him loved by fans and the media for his brave and picturesque figure. All of this created a mythical figure. Ali`s image was one of an undisputed champion, a person larger than life. However, that doesn’t mean he was the greatest boxer. He himself once noted that, pound for pound, Sugar Ray Robinson was better.",

He had a tendency to swim against the current a bit too far.

He declared himself as the greatest boxer (when he was still Cassius Clay), and was quoted numerous times saying how good, beautiful and talented he was. Amid his showman -like traits, he also disrespected his opponents. Sure, it’s part of boxing psychology, but, at times, he took it too far. Before one of their fights, he said: “Joe Frazier is an Uncle Tom. He works for the enemy.” He also referred to Frazier as an ugly man who “should give his face to The Wildlife Fund.” Great sportsmen should respect their opponents.",

Forman was one of the strongest punchers in the history of boxing. During their fight, Ali adopted the “ rope a dope ” tactic, where he allowed Forman to take shots at him just to tire Forman out. Ali took punch after punch, only to take Forman down in the eighth round.

At the beginning of 2018, the NFL announced the formation of a social justice committee to assist NFL players with promoting social justice causes and awareness for them. The committee said it would spend $100 million trying to improve education, police and community relations and the criminal justice system in NFL cities. Plus, Stephen Ross, managing general partner of the Miami Dolphins, co-chairs a national non-profit aimed at educating and empowering the sports community to improve race relations and eliminate discrimination. Additionally, despite the criticism that Colin Kaepernick has garnered, he succeeded to create a space in which important national conversations about race could finally take place. In courageously speaking his conscience, he inspired a generation of athletes and teams – and younger fans – to speak out and peacefully address social issues. He also became a cause for activists and social rights within the NFL. In fact, Nike’s 2018 decision to use Kaepernick as their spokesman, especially with the tag line “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” sends a big message to the NFL and its fans that freedom of speech and one’s conviction should be valued, not bullied or ignored. Fast forward to 2020, and the NFL has now admitted it was wrong in its response to Kaepernick and now supports his fight against racial injustice.",

That’s when Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem to protest ongoing police brutality and the overall oppression of black people in America. Faster than you can say “Hut!” his sitting turned into kneeling, which turned into sustained (and often vitriolic ) nationwide debates about race, police brutality, 1st amendment rights, and patriotism. NFL coaches, managers, sponsors and even two US presidents all weighed in, for better or for worse. Controversy continued even after the NFL passed a revised policy that mandates that players on the sidelines must stand for the national anthem or otherwise wait in the locker room. Fast forward to 2020, post-George Floyd riots (or, more accurately, because of them), and we see a more accepting, more socially and racially sensitive NFL . However, before arriving at this more compassionate and socially aware cornerstone, a 2017 nationwide poll showed that 19% of professional football fans lost interest in the NFL. Among them, 24% said political issues caused them to turn away, with 17% specifically blaming Kaepernick and his national anthem protest.

Today, tests are done randomly or in cases of suspicion (i.e. when records are broken), so for athletes that choose to use prohibited substances the worst-case scenario is to get caught and bear the responsibility of their actions themselves. But if we increase the cost of getting caught by punishing their olympic team, the individual athletes who used to use these substances would have to face harsher consequences both for themselves and their team if he/she is caught. They will have to face condemmnation by the team, probably have fights with their teammates, and the fact that they ruined the team's performance will give them a huge burden to carry throughout their entire life and will negatively effect their reputation with the fans. For instance, if a soccer player during a match is tempted to commit a gross foul during the game, and he knows he could be expelled for such an action, maybe he would not mind doing so, if for him it is not a big deal to stop playing. But since expulsion means the team will play with 10 players instead of 11, he knows such an action would bring a negative effect for the whole team, so this pressures him into being more careful not to break the rules, because his actions could punish the whole team. Therefore, teammates will be angry at the individual who committed the gross foul and would blame him for the problems he created for the entire team. So, this policy creates peer pressure. Athletes working within a team, will want their teammates to behave properly and not to consume prohibited substances. If those who do not use drugs did not care in the past about whether or not their teammates used drugs or not because that was \"their own business\", will now be forced to care since they could be affected. So now everyone is pressing drug-users to stop consuming them, because now it is everyone's business.",

The authors’ deeper look into statistics contradicts this claim. They assert that 38 out of 45 Super Bowls have been won by a top 10 defense and 22 have been won by a top 3 defense.

Gender perceptions have obviously come a long way in the last 100 years, but the media classification of women’s sport as inferior to men’s is severely slowing this progress in the field of sport. Humans are social beings with esteem needs, and as social beings we like to be viewed in a positive light by our peers. This is best achieved on a general level by conforming to social expectations and norm. This also applies for societal conceptions of gender. The fact that the media deems women’s sport to be of lesser importance which (as we have seen) conveys to the public this message, reinforces the notion that sport is not a worthwhile activity for women and girls. Instead, it is an activity more appropriate for men and boys. This kind of discourse has the effect of moulding gender identities both in terms of how men perceive women and how women perceive themselves. In this way, the lack of media coverage of women’s sport fuels a self-affirming perception of gender which effectively denies many young girls a realistic choice of becoming engaged in sport as perceptions affect confidence in one’s ability; as a result of this gender bias boys as young as six rate themselves as being much more competent in sports than girls do. This is because increased coverage will make sport seem like a worthwhile activity for girls and women. As more women take part in sport, this has a further cyclical effect of re-affirming gender conceptions around sport which, in turn, induces further women to become engaged in sport. This is a desirable outcome from the government’s perspective because sport has a positive impact on the health of those who are physically active. Those who are physically active are not only less likely to suffer from things like Coronary Heart Disease and cancer, but they have also been shown to lead more psychologically happy lives due to the endorphins released while exercising, and the joy of feeling physically fit.",

Two races capture the essence of these motorsports: F1’s Monaco Grand Prix and NASCAR’s Daytona 500.

Health care is another weak point for America. True, America is not the only country that was caught unprepared for the pandemic. However, perhaps its current health care system, with high costs and low medical capacity, contributed to the country’s vulnerability. America has long needed to invest in improving its health care system so that it can better promote health and equality, especially compared to other countries.",

For example, scholars at the Urban Institute, a prominent liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that a single-payer program would require a federal spending increase of $34 trillion over ten years, and total American health care spending would increase by $7 trillion.

These findings suggest that capital punishment may not actually be a deterrent for crime. The winds may be shifting regarding the public’s opinion about the death penalty. This is evident by the recent decision of a non-unanimous Florida jury to sentence the Parkland High School shooter to life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty .

        "content": "The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime. The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them1. Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise2. On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States1. In short, the death penalty can- and does- save the lives of innocent people. \"The Death Penalty Deters Crime and Saves Lives,\" August 28,2007.

Instead of, this house proposes other kind of measures as imprisonment with psychological treatment.

In that case, the person will be able to attempt in front of the judicial authorities his freedom, and return to the society. This is also adequate because judicial authorities can be wrong at the moment they condemn the person who is charged to commit terrorist acts. Anyway, even the judge is human, and he can be wrong at the moment he appreciates the facts that are not favorable to the suspect. His lawyer, maybe, is not enough prepared to make the defense (fact than can be checked in almost all the undeveloped countries) and this can lead to an adverse decision. If the suspect is condemned and the death penalty is executed, there won’t be any possible remedy to this flaw, and that means that an irreversible measure should always be a completely correct decision. A human decision, like the judge’s, that ever can be reviewed, will never be completely sure. On the other hand, imprisonment will always be a reversible measure and, as this house already stated, it can be effective to penalize a person who actually committed terrorist acts that cause death. This is wider fair, because we literally don’t sacrifice any innocent people’s right.

For Barbara Reynolds, former civil rights activist, “activists in the 1960s confronted white mobs and police with dignity and decorum… But at protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot.”10 From Protests to Ethno-Racial Coalitions Turning to the question of its impact, BLM protests have helped frame American politics."

While these incidents should be investigated and any impropriety addressed legally, financially, and organizationally, some people are using these incidents to question their own commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement. While unsolicited martyrs have become symbols of the Black Lives Matter movement, one key statistic drives it—Black people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be killed by police when they are unarmed and not attacking, and as in the case of Trayvon Martin, more likely to be profiled because of race. When it comes to addressing racism, some people tend to quickly forget what the Black Lives Matter movement is about."

After dividing states into two groups, permanent disenfranchisement or voting rights restoration post-release, they found that individuals were approximately 10% less likely to recidivate if they were released in automatic restoration states versus permanent disenfranchisement states.17 Hamilton-Smith and Vogel posit that felony disenfranchisement creates community reintegration barriers for justice-impacted individuals which becomes an additional contributor to future criminality. In 2023, Minnesota and New Mexico restored the right to vote for over 57,000 justice-impacted persons who are on felony probation or parole.35 In 2020, Washington, DC, became the third jurisdiction in the continental United States where individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction can vote.36 While this is progress, felony disenfranchisement remains deeply entrenched in this country."

For example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 election, accruing 48.2% of the vote in comparison to Trump’s 46.1%; the rest of the votes were split across candidates from independent parties.

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse.

While the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy suffered the heaviest job losses in the wake of NAFTA, wages decreased in many other sectors that don’t require workers to have a college degree."

In Andrews’ telling, NAFTA was merely the first of several important free trade dominos to fall, setting off a “chain of events that allowed globalization to run free the way it did.” NAFTA’s entrance into force on January 1, 1994, she notes, was accompanied around the same time by other important milestones of expanded economic integration including the agreement creating the World Trade Organization, the formation of the European Union, and the opening of the Chunnel connecting the United Kingdom and France. More relevant when evaluating a free trade agreement are economic outcomes — and from that perspective, NAFTA looks pretty good."

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade."

Bright potential candidates may be concerned about intrusion by political opponents into their private lives or backgrounds . They may be opposed in principle to participating in a political culture that obliges aspirant office holders to engage in smear- and fear-lead campaigning. Under the status quo, only those able to stomach the confrontational and bullying tactics that have grown up around contemporary electioneering will dare enter the political arena. Moreover, such trends in political culture favour candidates with close links to the media. Individuals able to command the ear of newspaper owners, or who possess a professional background in journalism or publicity will be better able to manipulate or evade attacks launched via television and mass communications. A democratic system is best served when it encourages the participation of candidates from a range of backgrounds and professional fields. The ability of a government to arrive at novel solutions to problems confronting a state, to understand that state’s economy and to effectively represent different sectors of the population will be compromised without a diverse skillset within the state’s legislative and executive branches. By transforming politics into a game based on the production of political “brands” and unassailable, manufactured “personalities,” the jousting and muckraking of negative campaigning gives a disproportionate advantage to former editors and PR men . This dilutes the pool of professionals from which future leaders are drawn, leading to poor policy making (due to a lack of professional skills) and a conservative, sclerotic, defensive approach to political problem solving. Western liberal politics is increasingly discussed only in terms of communication, image, rhetoric and appearance , rather than the technical language of law, economics and diplomacy. Negative campaigning artificially limits the types of people and professions who can engage in political discourse, infantilising and disabling politics itself.",

Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition. A ban my undermine attempts to alter pupil’s mindsets and their perspective on food marketing and their own diets.",

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to place primary responsibility with the states for redistricting, but it also clearly preserves the ability of Congress to set federal rules as appropriate. Numerous states have had to redistrict following judicial rulings that their maps violate principles of the Constitution or other laws around redistricting. In Rucho v Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively leaving it up to plaintiffs to prove that any redistricting harm stems from something beyond party affiliation. Redistricting is a state process but is also governed by the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and judicial precedent. In most states, the legislature is responsible for drawing both their congressional and legislative district lines, typically through the standard lawmaking process and often subject to gubernatorial veto."

Free to gerrymander, the Republican-controlled legislature redrew the map, and after the 2024 election, North Carolina saw three Democratic districts flip to Republicans, enough to give control of the U.S. House to the GOP by a slim margin.

Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect."

Only a global focus on combating the basic causes of climate change will tackle the problem in a fair and equitable way, as richer nations cut back on their carbon-enriched lifestyles while developments in technologies offer benefits to the world as a whole rather than those who are already carbon rich as a result of geological or historical accident .",

In companys today, a lot of people lose their jobs from saying the wrong things, which is a lot of times related to sexual harrasment.

Just like saying offending things about someone's race is just as bad as harrassing someone at work. I know of people that lose their jobs from saying and doing the wrong things at work. Sometimes, one employee could not appreciate what you say but the other employee keeps saying it, that could get you in big trouble especially if you know that the person doesn't appreciate it. If an employee is married, and a co-worker has a crush on that employee and tries to get involved with her by saying things that could imply to her that he is trying and already knows that she is married and doesn't appreciate it then that is harrasment. If these kinds of things happen and no one corrects the employee that was doing and saying all the wrong things then that would just give the company a bad name and it would also cause the workers to not want to work at a company like that. All employees want to work at a place where they feel safe and comfortable. Also, employees like jobs that actually show that they care about them.

As a professional employee we tend to forget that when we are employed we not only represent ourselves but we also represent the company and the employer. Also, professional employees need to remember that being professional means that in any situation it is not appropriate to say anything that would offend other employees or customers. Sometimes, employees take their personal lives to work and it sometimes cause problems to arise. There are employees who try to find other co-workers to confide in and it ends up leaking out to other co-workers and rumors spread and then problems occur. These are sometimes what causes people to say things that are wrong or shouldn't be said at all. Being humans, we tend to say things without thinking about it. Sometimes we think we are helping with the problem but we just end up making it worse. For example, from personal experience, Sam's Club is a really great place to work. You learn a lot from working there, at least i did from working in the jewelry department. But the big problem over there is people tend to get in trouble by saying things that are wrong. Like, spreading rumors about people or just saying something offending to a co-worker gets you in trouble. Especially if it deals with that persons race, religion, and anything that could offend that person. One of my co-workers was jokingly talking about the stereotypes of another country not knowing that the co-worker in the same room was from there and it offended her. The guy that made the joke got written up and got a warning. I honestly believe that it is wrong to say things that could be offending because everyone has feelings and if it's too the extreme of making someone not wanting to come back to work or something that would make the company's reputation bad then yes i believe that people should lose their jobs for it.",

In an attempt to free American hostages held by Lebanese terrorists and to support Nicaraguan Contras, Reagan’s administration covertly sold weapons to Iran and funneled the proceeds to the Latin American rebels. The former was both illegal – there was an embargo against shipping arms to Iran – and a violation of his campaign pledge not to negotiate with terrorists. The latter violated a Congressional ban against operations in Nicaragua. The operation was a failure; while three hostages were released, three more were soon abducted. When the operation came to light, it badly damaged Reagan’s reputation and led to charges against 14 people in the administration, including Oliver North .",

However, in 2022, they officially exited bankruptcy following the largest public debt restructuring in US history. Since Puerto Rico is not currently a U.S. state, it was unable to access Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code , when it fell on financial hardship. What’s more, even if Puerto Rico could access these rights, at that time, he island’s $49 billion of unfunded pension liabilities and $74 billion debt, held by the territory’s government as well as by local public corporations, was so great that they could only cover one-third of the accrued debt. If granted statehood, the U.S. would have inherited this debt. The question is, can the U.S. cope with the challenges that making Puerto Rico a state would impose, or would America (and its national treasury) drown in the process? The aftermath of Hurricane Maria brings up another serious aspect to consider. If Puerto Rico becomes a U.S. state, it would require a lot of money and resources from FEMA every time a natural disaster occurs. Due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Florence, FEMA is already stretched too thin, and several communities within the U.S. are still awaiting assistance.

They do this because they feel that the state is allowing them to make their own decisions and as such the state is showing its trust in its citizens. This bond of trust between the state and the citizens as well as the state giving the citizens their own responsibilities means that citizens respect the state for the fact that it does not limit them. To examine this from a point of view that does not rely on moral consequentialism and a utility based principle, it is possible to say that the state should afford people liberty and freedom because the starting point of any rational moral calculus should be the admission that an individual is the best judge of what is in his own interest. To not give people choice is ultimately an idea that dehumanises people. As such, the only time where freedoms should truly be restricted is when allowing the freedom results in a greater level of dehumanisation among the people. So for example, we prevent murder because allowing people to kill one another results in allowing some people to entirely remove other people’s ability to choose on purpose.",

Israelis strongly feel that if they don’t manage the Palestinian situation, they and their family members can be raped and murdered . It’s as simple as that.

They do this because they feel that the state is allowing them to make their own decisions and as such the state is showing its trust in its citizens. This bond of trust between the state and the citizens as well as the state giving the citizens their own responsibilities means that citizens respect the state for the fact that it does not limit them. To examine this from a point of view that does not rely on moral consequentialism and a utility based principle, it is possible to say that the state should afford people liberty and freedom because the starting point of any rational moral calculus should be the admission that an individual is the best judge of what is in his own interest. To not give people choice is ultimately an idea that dehumanises people. As such, the only time where freedoms should truly be restricted is when allowing the freedom results in a greater level of dehumanisation among the people.

In Sudan, if the war-related famine again becomes severe, dividing the country into an Arab north and a Christian south may save the vast majority of threatened Sudanese lives at the lowest cost in dollars—and in the blood of intervening troops. But muscular interventions in wars like those in Angola and Congo will probably not happen until more countries develop the military capabilities for such operations—which brings us to the final question. Although the United States need not create a specialized armed force for peace operations, it should modify its military force structure to lessen the strain of various types of limited missions around the world. Even if such countries cannot be expected to lead forcible interventions, they can provide valuable combat forces that enable peacekeeping missions to uphold ceasefires and peace accords under challenge."

America excels at incorporating disparate voices and interests into its varied fabric; the far left, far right, and everyone in between have equal protections for expression and assembly, protections which are by no means guaranteed in other countries .",

        "content": "According to the Geneva convention the principle of proportionality states that harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated in an attack on a military objective. Military objective is defined are defined to be those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage . When a state is in conflict with a non-state actor we think that a legitimate military objective is the capture (extraterriotorial if neccessary) of combatants of that non-state actor. In the case of terrorist networks individuals can bare a lot of power. There are terrorist ''king-pins'', who control and moralize other terrorists and are in possession of important information about the network. The capture of these individuals can be a blow to the terrorist organization, because it loses an experienced member who can train others and demoralizes the organization. Of course it also disarms this individual and limits his capacity to threaten the state further. With this we establish that there is a definite military advantage in the capture of such individuals. But is it proportional to the damage done to civilians? To justify the proportionality of extra-territorial rendition we have to look at what kind of damage it can bring to the civilian population of other states. The proposition has brought out that sometimes innocent individuals will be captured. Against this we argue that during the course of the trial the innocence or guilt of the captured individuals has to emerge. When it is established that the individual was indeed innocent the damage done to that person can be reversed by returning him to his home state. If however the individual is guilty, his capture would have potentially lead to the saving of lives of many civilians and thus is a proportional act. For proportional response to ever be applied, it is required that a country should have access to the entire spectrum of possible responses. Otherwise, it is impossible to select the response which matches the cause with the required severity. When options are taken from the table, what happens? Inevitably, a country will be left between two options, one which is less severe than that required, and one which is more severe. Even if we assume the country has mercy in its soul, and opts for the less response, the lack of proportionality will mean that it will not have fully served its purpose in cutting off the threat which provoked it, thereby making it less effective than the response that direct proportionality requires. Unfortunately, even this best case scenario is unlikely to happen. Countries are less sensitive to foreign deaths than those of their own citizens. Therefore, the path most chosen is likely to be that of greater than proportional vengeance, and therefore greater than proportional bloodshed. The importance of allowing small scale solutions to small scale problems is one widely recognised, at least implicitly, by modern nation states. Most nation states operate intelligence agencies, and many of these conduct operations overseas, often without the knowledge of local governments. And yet, the operations of these agents, who are the agents of a foreign state, and often involve the collection of sensitive information, or materials, is not, and is unlikely to ever be, considered a warcrime. The reason, is because without these small scale, surgical instruments at hand, states would have only far heavier tools for dismantling threats to their existence. In the case of extroardinary rendition. Certainly, there are some scenarios when a suspect would simply be left alone. But is it to be expected that any government would simply allow an individual who is plotting the murder of its citizens to continue unobstructed? Far more likely for goverrnments to take more drastic measures, from openly declared strikes and incursions, to placing economic, military, or political pressure on state leaders to permit the extradition and interrogation of their suspect. Both alternatives are far more damaging to long term political relations between the countries, and far less likely to be effective in stemming the short term problem. War crimes law should be designed to defuse conflict, not incite it.",

When President Obama left office on January 20, 2017, his impact and legacy were unclear. With Republicans in control of both the presidency and the Congress in 2017, however, some of Obama’s most notable achievements—the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate change agreement, and Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals—were overturned or under attack. Obama’s lasting impact on American life may turn out to have been greatest in terms of the crises that did not happen. In a C-SPAN survey of 91 historians, political scientists, and other presidential scholars, Obama was ranked 12th among all presidents since George Washington for the overall quality of his performance as chief executive. Bush, who ranked 33rd, Bill Clinton (15th), and George H.W. Bush (20th), but not the president whose trajectory-changing legacy Obama once said he wanted to emulate: Ronald Reagan, who ranked 8th. ###### Barack Obama Presidency Page. ###### Life Before the Presidency."

(There are some principled conservative writers and intellectuals trying to resist this tendency but, so far, well… note who is the president-elect.) To name just a few central examples: the sheer hysteria about a modest healthcare bill – frequently labelled ‘the death of freedom’ by GOP politicians; the insane efforts to label Obama un-American (led by Trump!) and a dangerous Muslim; and, as important, the procedural radicalism of the congressional Republicans, engineered by the party’s top strategist, senate leader Mitch McConnell (shutting down the government, insisting on a supermajority requirement for every bill, denying Obama the right to fill the supreme court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Scalia, and much else)."

And from then on, the Obama presidency struggled under a radicalized Republican Party. Coleman notes, “In the summer of 2012, under pressure from party activists to show some effort on immigration reform before the November election and unable to rise above the partisanship that dominated Washington as he had hoped, President Obama turned to his executive powers and announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.” But again we see the weakness of executive action."

Given that the intent of hate crimes is more malicious than simple premeditative murder; it is just to enhance hate crime laws to reflect stronger punishment. Hate crimes don't merely victimize the individual upon whom violence is inflicted, they also victimize a community or minority group that the hate crime was intended to terrorize. This is why hate crimes frequently include highly public acts such as lynchings in town squares, dragging hate crime victims behind cars along streets inhabited by certain communities, and graffiti on significant buildings -they are intended to send a message. Hate crime-delivered messages limit the freedom of expression and group association of the victim community, thus violating their liberties. For this reason, hate crimes have more victims than other crimes, and subsequently deserver greater punishment. Moreover, as hate crimes are generally perpetrated against minority groups, and because these minority groups are always in a state of social disenfranchisement; it could be argued that hate crime enhancements are the state's way of attempting to arbitrate equality to minorities by compensating them with laws that will better favour their interests, thus forcibly \"balancing the scale\" of social equity.",

She explained that “if words can cause stress, and if prolonged stress can cause physical harm, then certain types of speech can be a form of violence.” Words also create an atmosphere that incites physical harm, as evidenced in the systematic murdering of millions at the hands of the Nazis, made possible after propaganda laid the groundwork for hate.

When Americans use drones for targeting killings, other countries are likely to follow her lead. For example, China has weighed using drone strikes in Myanmar to deter illegal drug trade. With the definition of terrorist groups highly dependent on the goals of each individual government, it’s easy to imagine how drone warfare could devolve into a free-for-all. Another example: the use and availability of drones are increasing casualties and intensities of regional clashes in areas like Armenia and Azerbaijan that, until now, have been limited by such countries’ inability to wage air campaigns. On a larger scale, a 2022 deadly drone attack in the middle of Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels may mean an escalation of violence in an already volatile region. And let’s not forget about Syria, where the US and Russia are supporting opposing sides. US drone strikes (unintentionally?) hit a Russian-made tank as well as Russian military bases during previous defensive strikes against pro-Syrian forces. Who’s to say such drone strikes won’t lead to a tit-for-tat?",

Drones proved adept in reaching the remote areas of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria, among other countries, where the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, among others, conducted (and still do) their terrorist activities. Daniel Blyman, a researcher with the Center for Middle East Policy, points out that drone strikes not only “defanged” al-Qaeda by neutralizing high-ranking combatants (and even the highest-ranking leaders, as was the case with Biden’s 2022 drone strike against Osama bin Laden’s predecessor, Ayman al-Zawahiri ), but also made it nearly impossible for them to train new combatants, convene, or use telecommunications of any kind. More than accomplishing American counterterrorism objectives, drone strikes are often the only defense local communities in tribal regions of countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have against terrorist groups that tyrannize them. For those who are regularly subjected to suicide bombings or whose children risk being abducted and taken to terrorist training camps, drone strikes provide a much-welcomed reprieve from terrorists’ violence. Not to mention, drone technology keeps advancing to make them even more efficient and effective: Take for instance just one development that allows operators to coordinate multiple drones simultaneously and overwhelm aggressors’ defensive capabilities.",

In general, drone strikes cost far less in human life than other kinds of warfare. This is owing to drone strikes’ precision. Whereas airplanes must quickly fire their weapons and depart the area, drones can hover above their targets for several hours, providing real-time surveillance that allows operators to detect non-combatants and wait for them to evacuate before firing. Additionally, drone weaponry is significantly smaller than those used in airstrikes. Their small blast radius safeguards against collateral damage, and they even have features that allow a misfire to be quickly corrected. A Slate report found that traditional forms of warfare, including airstrikes, missiles and ground operations kill around three times as many civilians as drone strikes.",

Similarly, in 2013, Pakistan’s prime minister repeatedly called upon Barak Obama to cease drone strikes there, citing the need for collaboration on security matters. Just as the United States would not tolerate any country operating on its soil without permission, the US should not expect such actions will be tolerated by other nations. Plus, the 2018 assassination attempt of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro involving drones carrying explosives goes to show how drones, in unrestrained hands, can increase instead of decrease geopolitical instability.

The Pentagon’s 2024 fiscal-year budget of $842 billion, the largest, nominal-dollar peacetime budget ever, includes spending requests for the procurement of 1000 drone wingmen to accompany combat aircraft.

Professor Cleveland said that the administration has claimed that these groups have joined with Al-Qaeda in the fight against the United States and thus should be treated as “co-belligerents.” Professor Koh then turned the discussion to Daniel Cahen to focus on how force may be used — i.e., assuming one has resolved the various issues raised by Professor Cleveland and has concluded that the use of lethal force is lawful."

Putin became president a half a year after Yeltsin was maneuvered into allowing the dismemberment of Russia’s ally, Serbia, and as he entered office Putin said: “We will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians, or any threat to the integrity of the country.”. The degradation of Russia’s position represented by the Serbian War is what Putin was alluding to when he famously described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” This statement is often misunderstood or mischaracterized: he did not mean by it any desire to return to Communism."

Greenspan saw two recessions during nearly two decades. These bookended the longest expansion in US history, as the country saw 10 years of GDP growth. From 1992 to 1999, the economy grew an average of 4 percent per year , a rate unseen in the post-Greenspan era. Greenspan was also a steady hand through two Gulf Wars and 9/11. The financial crisis must be factored into any evaluation of Alan Greenspan’s accomplishments but should not overshadow all else.",

Greenspan spent the years before the crisis repeatedly warning that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored entities created by Congress to facilitate mortgage lending, had overstepped their mandate and were overleveraged, adding systemic risk to the housing market. He called for both GSEs to be more heavily regulated (which, it’s worth adding, goes against the claim that he had an ideological aversion to regulation). Much ink has been spilled debating whether Fannie and Freddie caused the 2008 financial crisis. Without venturing into that debate, it’s safe to say that, after the federal takeover of both organizations, Greenspan was on the right side of history on this issue.",

One example of Greenspan’s deregulatory zeal is his role in weakening and eventually scrapping the Glass-Steagall act , which allowed “too big to fail” banks to get even bigger. And for years, he opposed efforts to regulate derivatives , which spun out of control in the leadup to the crisis.

Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

The recent discovery of a super-Earth planet 31 light-years away , and that it could harbor life, suggests that there could be a potentially habitable world outside of our solar system. Even within our own solar system there are several celestial bodies boasting the potential to support life. Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa , for example, contains both a source of radiation strong enough to lead to chemical reactions and evidence of an ocean similar to Earth’s. Similarly, the conditions of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus , could already support an Earth-born microbe (a microscopic organism that is too small to be seen with the naked eye), what with its liquid ocean and hydrothermal reactions. While many speculate that the life we uncover on these moons will likely be microbial , it would be the first step in learning how to search for more complex life forms within our galaxy.",

Astronomers have found the clearest evidence yet that life might exist beyond the solar system, from the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years away from Earth, setting off rare excitement – tinged with caution – in the global scientific community. So where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism? That was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun – the distance from a sun where it’s neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. To explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns. The findings of the Cambridge-led team follow a series of breakthroughs in recent years that have excited scientists about the possibilities of finding life beyond Earth."

Suppose we do go to Mars, he says, and find living organisms in the subsurface that are DNA based, like life on Earth.

Each year since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on January 1, 1994, officials in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have regularly declared the agreement to be an unqualified success. NAFTA, while extending protections for investors, explicitly excluded any protections for working people in the form of labor standards, worker rights, and the maintenance of social investments. These reports, based in part on more comprehensive labor market surveys in all three countries,1 show that the impact on workers in each nation has been different according to their circumstances. Contrary to what the American promoters of NAFTA promised U.S. workers, the agreement did not result in an increased trade surplus with Mexico, but the reverse. As Bruce Campbell of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives reports, Canada’s increased market integration with the United States began in 1989 with the bilateral Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to NAFTA."

In Andrews’ telling, NAFTA was merely the first of several important free trade dominos to fall, setting off a “chain of events that allowed globalization to run free the way it did.” NAFTA’s entrance into force on January 1, 1994, she notes, was accompanied around the same time by other important milestones of expanded economic integration including the agreement creating the World Trade Organization, the formation of the European Union, and the opening of the Chunnel connecting the United Kingdom and France. More relevant when evaluating a free trade agreement are economic outcomes — and from that perspective, NAFTA looks pretty good."

In a recent study that de-emphasized the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy, economists David Autor (MIT), David Dorn (University of Zurich) and Gordon Hanson (University of California, San Diego) stress the role of China’s emergence on job growth and wages in the U.S. In the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they write: “China’s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade."

It seems that this hurting of the general public is a tool that unions will use to get what they want. Moreover, union violence has been used in the past, such as in the Occupy Oakland strike of 2011, which culminated in violent riots that were later condoned by the US Supreme Court.

Estate tax is something that effectively destroys family businesses. We definitely do not claim that it is happening in all an every instance, but there are cases where such taxation is disruptive to businesses. Consider a family business of substantial value. It has been successful for many years, expanding at a rapid pace. The owner was happy to finance the expansion with retained earnings – but now he finds himself in trouble, because in case of his death, his son would not be able to pay without selling a share of his business. These are the situations we are extremely discontent with, because people who create the most value in our society are unjustly punished. Scientific studies show detrimental effects of inheritance taxes to entrepreneurial activity. Holtz-Eakin finds evidence that entrepreneurs would decrease business expansion if they would be subject to estate tax after death.

Their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to act collectively to bargain for better wages. The minimum wage frees people from this bondage and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices. Because people’s choices are intrinsically interconnected, and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply, when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else, he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask, leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another, each competing to prove he is worth the least. A minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition. People want to be happy, and find that only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment.

This makes them the easiest to manipulate and the easiest to replace. Certainly, it is far better for state, which has citizens’ best interest at heart, to weigh in on the issue of setting wages than businesses, which tend not to care about their workers’ welfare or have competing interests. Furthermore, a minimum wage sends a social signal of valuation; it affirms that all people have worth, cannot be exploited, and are owed by dint of their humanity a certain level of treatment in the workforce, i.e. This is important as a means to assist the self-empowerment of the poorest members of society, by encouraging them to value themselves.

It would clearly be in taxpayers interest if the state is able to make a profit out of the investments that taxpayers funding creates as this would mean taxes could be lower.

What I recognize of even the most educational shows they are benificial only to a very general understanding of the topic. Channels such as the history channel are hardly historical and even when they are they are careless to speak with enough accuracy to discriminate between very unliklyness and truth claims. There is often a motivation to make certain topics more exciting but often with the cost of oversimplification. Moreover in attempt to reach greater audiences shows are capped at a intellectual capacity of the casual person. But for a deep level of understanding books can be particularly selected to meet the optimal requirements for the learner. For there may be use in learning basic generals of a topic. But the computer really is the better source then both books or tv. especially with the increase of e-books and the ability to select for individual capacities. But books inable to reader to learn at thier own pace and process information at a pace best for them, while a tv show requires less effort. the learner loses information when attemping to contemplate over a concept of interest for they either miss the continuing the information or do not fully benifit at the from absorbtion of information caused by deeper processing. One of the intuitive motivation for tv vs books is the effort required vs pleasure recieved. For just like any new system of understanding such as learning a new language or learning to type.. once the skill is mastered the effort required for value drops thus increasing the motivation to take advantage of the new skill. thus mastery of reading increases the rate you of value you get out of reading vs the effort put in.. That is for the unpractised reader may be more motivated for tv then books. But as you become more skilled the more you reading becomes valuable.

Taking them out of the shops will leave greater problems since many people smoke because they are addicted and not because they enjoy it. Making something illegal is of course easier than it seems. We must weigh in not only the reasons why, but also how are we going to implement a certain set of provision. We have to realise that making something illegal does not automatically solve a problem, instead it might create even more problems as a repercussion to such a decision. Making illicit drugs such as heroine, cocaine, etc. was agreeably a good decision. However, the consequences of making such commendable decisions also involve the allocation of large amounts of state resources (read: tax payer money) to combat illegal drug trafficking. Apparently, making these drugs illegal did not really stop people from using the drugs (fyi: drugs are still a lucrative business, if not why would people risk their lives to smuggle it). That said, the same goes for cigarettes, I don't see any strong reason that making cigarettes (or smoking them) illegal to be of any use in the context of making people quit the bad habit. People who smoke are addicted to it, and as those people who are addicted to illicit drugs, they will always find ways to circumvent the law. Making smoking illegal does not automatically make the business less profitable. As I see it, the demand for cigarettes are still high everywhere, and this kind of policy would only create \"black markets\" for the item. This in turn would put burden on the law enforcement to combat such black markets (read: more personnel, more funds needed), and of course these burdens would be passed on to tax payers who pays for all the cost of faithfully enforcing such a new law. I believe that the restrictions and requirements which are already in place (i.e. restricting smoking areas, limited advertisement methods) are sufficient enough to tackle the problem. Moreover, the current approach is right on track where the government should sponsor and support policies that would decrease the demand for cigarettes (if the demand for cigarettes were to fall substantially, the business would be less lucrative, and soon enough nobody will be in the cigarette business). This is not a policy that would effectively reduce the demand, simply making it illegal is not addressing to the demand problem.Thus, what I see in this is another burden for the state budget, with little or minimal impact on the real issue at hand.",

His failures were many before his success – though the failures don’t seem to end. Most recently, Musk decided to walk away from the $44 billion Twitter deal despite the legal and reputational risks. Previously, Musk was removed from his CEO position at t wo of his own companies , survived malaria, and oversaw three failed launches after the creation of SpaceX (which left the company almost bankrupt). In 2018, he settled with the SEC after being accused of misleading investors and agreed to step down as Tesla chairman, pay a $20 million fine but to remain as CEO. That same year, a Los Angeles court found Musk not guilty of defamation after he made a series of Tweets, calling a British diver who was part of the life-saving efforts of a Thai youth soccer team a pedophile after the diver rejected Musk’s offer of a submarine.

Musk plays his own part in this comparison, creating the perception that he’s the sole embodiment of technological prowess. Yet, it’s easy to forget that, in reality, Musk wouldn’t have been able to get where he is without government funding , subsidies for electric cars, etc. Furthermore, Musk’s elevation by the public to a capitalist idol “has distorted the flow of capital and talent. Healthy markets don’t take cues from the tweets of one man,” writes American author and business professor Scott Galloway . For example, Musk’s outsized influence on raising (or lowering, in the case of Dogecoin ) the value, popularity and production of cryptocurrency has masked the truth that the high level of carbon emissions from increased mining of Bitcoin significantly reduces if not wipes out any carbon savings of Teslas.",

Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities.

The N.P.V(net present value) of payments of financial fees to private companies in the case of privatizing securities will be a dramatic profit of $940 billion over 75 years. However, such funds can never benefit the ordinary citizens of the U.S and other market-based economies. For the sole reason that it is too risky. While and we have said this before; for economies that are largely bank-based the market and thus private pension funds play a rather unimportant insignificant role in terms of citizen welfare. As companies/schemes/funds rise and fall based on their relations with prominent banks and not on the ups and downs of markets; in a market economy once pension funds are privatized wall street benefits, the public is duped and most(if not all) of us are victimized by financial scams of the kind noted earlier. The market is unpredictable; we the citizens of these nations are not equipped with the financial expertise required to handle our own finances. Wall street is wary of the tricks of the trade and how to bend the rules to favor finance gurus. Betting on two opposite future outcomes is one such tactic. If everyone was taught finance in school things would be different; however, that is not presently the case.

Bill Gates, COP30, climate change, global health, energy innovation, Breakthrough Energy, poverty and climate, health and climate, Green Premium, agriculture and climate, climate adaptation, health in poor countries, climate truths, three climate truths, global emissions, global warming, world energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, progress on climate change Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world. This will become even more important if new evidence shows that climate change will be much worse than what the current generation of climate models predicts, because we will need to lower the Green Premium faster and accelerate the transition to a zero-emission economy."

As writers like Linsey McGoey have pointed out, a disturbing amount of the money that Gates gives away for poorer countries seems to end up in the hands of corporations and universities in richer ones. | \\_tracking\\_consent | 1 year | Shopify sets this cookie to store a user's preferences if a merchant has set up privacy rules in the visitor's region. | scribd\\_ubtc | 1 year 1 month 4 days | Scribd sets this cookie to gather data on user behaviour across several websites and maximise the relevancy of the advertisements on the website."

But cyberbullying doesn’t just affect kids and teens; adults are also victimized by cyberbullies, especially on Twitter . As users can open and operate multiple fake Twitter accounts, it is easy for anyone to claim to be someone else – impersonating people to either spread fake news or hurt others. In fact, it’s easier to create a fake personality on Twitter than on other social media platforms, since it demands much less visual evidence of users’ private lives. Take feminist writer Lindy West , who was stalked and harassed by a fellow Twitter user pretending to be her deceased dad. Even those who don’t hide behind fake profiles can troll others, taunting users with abusive, racist and anti-Semitic tweets. The former US president himself was also known to make offensive tweets . Even before the Jan. 6 riots , Twitter, which was used by protestors to encourage participation in events that day, had already started making efforts to mitigate cyberbullying and tweets that were perceived to potentially encourage or glorify violence . However, the platform is challenging to monitor; it’s often healthier for innocent victims to close their Twitter accounts.",

I tend to be pretty skeptical of this scenario: America has outlasted challengers before and China seems to me to have remarkable strengths, yes, but also serious weaknesses. Dan Wang is a keen observer of contemporary China, and his new book,” Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future,” argues that the Trump administration’s current trade war is wrongheaded or too late, and that American pre-eminence can be preserved if we imitate the things that China is getting right. *Below is an edited transcript of an episode of “Interesting Times.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect."

A 2014 study on the environmental costs and benefits of fracking claims that fracking could potentially release toxic chemicals into the air and water, in addition to contaminating drinking water through surface spills and other means. Wastewater disposal – a byproduct of fracking that gets injected into the ground – is partially responsible for a hundredfold increase in man-made earthquakes, threatening 3.5 million people a year. Additionally, there is evidence that fracking causes severe methane leaks , which traps heat in our atmosphere and can be devastating for the climate.",

Thanks to fracking, America is now a leading natural gas producer, in addition to increasing potential oil and gas exports. This has lowered US dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas; according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), shale production from fracking helped reduce foreign petroleum imports by over 40% since 2006. This significantly reduced the price of gas and created a huge boom in domestic oil production.",

When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed,  and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation. They created a “candy cart” – which now brings them income for sports equipment or other necessities. One of the pupils, Edgar Coker (18-year-old senior) explained that: “If I couldn’t buy it here, I’d bring it from home.” It is difficult to regulate junk food consumption through unsophisticated measures such as prohibition.

Republican support is much higher than it was in May 2020, when 56% favored more fracking. More broadly, majorities of Democrats oppose all forms of fossil fuel development we asked about in our recent survey, including offshore oil and gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and coal mining.

If this is the case, then a leak’s harm would be limited to the layers of sediment nearby which would be unaffected by radiation.

Further nuclear waste might reach water sources should there be a leak above ground, if it is raining heavily when the leak happens for example. Further, the other options available, such as above ground storage present a potentially greater danger, should something go wrong. This is because it is much easier for nuclear waste to leak radiation into the air. This is problematic because even a hint of radiation may well cause people to panic owing to the damaging and heavily publicised consequences of previous nuclear safety crises. As such, underground storage is safer both directly and indirectly. Focus and specialisation of this type is much more likely to avert a serious release of nuclear material from an underground facility than the broad and general approach that will be fostered by diverse and distinct above-ground storage solutions. The contributor may be referring to the ejection of irradiated dust and other particulates that has occurred when nuclear power stations have suffered explosive containment failures, but this is not comparable to the types of containment failures that might happen in facilities used to store spent nuclear fuel rods and medical waste.

This commodification of the human body and mind can go so far that humans actually start selling themselves: free market proponents propose to legalize the selling of one’s own organs. When humans start selling themselves, they perceive no value in themselves anymore – all they see in themselves is an instrument to satisfy other people’s desires, a product to be packaged and sold. This becomes even more pronounced when we take into account that the free market exacerbates inequality: if someone is born into a poor family and can’t get out of it, it might seem the only way to get out of it, is to sell oneself.

The internet’s price wars have an influence beyond cyberspace – many brick-and-mortar stores have adopted online price-matching policies in order to stay competitive with their online counterparts. Not to mention that swift “on-demand” order and delivery has changed consumer expectations (supply-chain problems aside), making convenience and comfort an ideal they can take for granted.",

In contrast, digital marketing (or more specifically product marketing) is thought of as part of an ongoing process in which feedback is collected and product improvements are made continuously. Through marketing data (i.e., how many people have reacted to a specific message or product), customers get to influence the products they consume. This integration of marketing into the company’s core business is key to the rise of many online giants. For companies like Booking.com, the optimization of marketing reach is what determines their revenue. The publishing industry’s revenue is comprised of the gap between the cost of acquiring a user and the money that can be made during their stay on a website (ads, subscription, etc.). There is a whole subset of businesses that drive traffic to other sites for a portion of revenue. Their whole operation is nothing but online marketing. Digital marketing also opened up new opportunities for small and medium business, where traditional marketing offered very few options for a local business. Digital marketing enhances the voice and precision of any interested individual for any budget and with minimal know-how.",

For these analytical minds, excel makes more sense than a creative hunch. A spreadsheet displaying CTR (click through rates) percentage over time is something they easily ‘get’; hence, they welcome performance marketing. In other words, digital marketing is their default choice – not because it’s necessarily better than traditional marketing but because it’s more familiar. This is also true for marketing agencies. With digital marketing, you have the playbook pretty much written before the client enters. The crucial know-how (CPC, CPA, CTR, etc.) relates to the media, not to the specific product. This is very different from traditional advertising, where you have to tailor a new suit for each creative challenge.

While we have considered the social, economic as well as environmental sides of the debate, the Prop have only considered the environmental impacts. They have even said, “ is the main point of this debate.” While we have continuously urged them to consider the welfare of citizens as well as the economy of a nation they have simply refused to negotiate on the real-life effects that high taxes would have on multiple stakeholders on both a domestic and global scale. The unfortunate truth is that we live in a volatile global reality, where corruption and mismanagement of government budgets are both a reality for over half the world’s nations . We have provided evidence on the corrupted nature of many resource rich governments and this proves this is a problem that must be considered when looking at the effectiveness of implementing these high taxes. We have also continuously pointed out that one of the main issues associated with implementing a high tax in resource rich nations is the trust that can be held in their governments. We have raised this question a number of times and all we have heard in response is that “if governments... are not interested in the welfare of their people, this is a problem beyond the scope of our motion”. We feel this is in fact a major problem that must be dealt with prior to establishing a new global norm of high taxation on mining and extraction industries as the negative implications and costs to the majority of resource rich countries will be too great. The realistic social and political impacts that the implementation of such tax will have on ALL stakeholders involved has been considered by us but ignored by the prop. The Prop have also graciously agreed that by implementing a high tax “the companies will buy less in order to stay within their budget.” This only proves that the implementation of such high taxes will mean that companies will be forced to reduce spending on current technologies and practices rather than encourage investment in developing new, environmentally and economically sustainable ones. The Prop have made several unsubstantiated assertions throughout their argument and they have ignored the realistic negative effects that we have proven to exist. In particular the rise in the cost of commodities would devastate the people of those nations as well negatively effect both import and export profits. There are better ways to achieve what the Prop has proposed and this must be achieved through incentives and pressure on companies rather than simply increasing tax.",

If higher taxes discourage a business from opening or expanding, it is not just the rich who suffer but also the workers who are not hired. Further, this means that tax hikes often do not have the intended effect of raising revenue. If high taxes slow down economic growth, the government ends up taxing a smaller amount of money at a higher rate. Sometimes, this means a tax hike actually leads to lower total revenues, but even in less extreme cases, tax hikes yield diminishing returns .",

Advocates of a wealth tax argue that it would be an effective means of raising revenues while addressing wealth and income inequality and affecting only a tiny fraction of U.S. households. To illustrate the basic concept, consider a simple example of a 2 percent wealth tax imposed on all individual or household net worth above $100 million (the exemption threshold). ### A Wealth Tax Would Raise Revenues. Using those estimates, if a 1 percent wealth tax were imposed on all assets comprising that base and no evasion occurred, the tax would raise an additional $94 billion, or about 3 percent of total federal revenues in 2019; if enforcement were weak and base erosion were 50 percent, the amount of revenues raised would be half as large."

A wealth tax would require taxpayers to pay at regular intervals on the appreciation of their assets, regardless of whether they have the cash or liquid assets to pay. Under her plan, high-wealth taxpayers would likely pay taxes on their capital gains each year as their assets appreciate in value. Even a very wealthy individual may not have the liquid assets to pay the tax on their changes in wealth. Under Harris’s proposal, taxpayers who don’t have cash to pay taxes may  have to borrow money or sell. *Nathan Goldman and Christina Lewellen are associate professors of accounting in the Poole College of Management.*"

In the intervening decades, V.R. has thrived at two extremes in the quest for “killer apps.” It has long been an established industrial technology: if you’ve flown, ridden, or sailed in a factory-built vehicle in the last thirty years, virtual reality may have played a central role. Nonetheless, experiences will come from all kinds of companies, and V.R. could agitate and depress people even more than the little screens on smartphones. In the early days of V.R., I actually tried living in it all the time; on a number of occasions, I stayed in virtual reality for several days."

In the event of flight delays, cancellations or luggage misplacement, traditional airlines have policies in place to offer passengers travel rerouting, refunds and compensation packages. This is something that low-cost airlines are not always able to do, as was seen with the 2018 Ryanair airline strike , during which hundreds of flights were cancelled. Another example is the case of Icelandic low-cost airline Wow Airlines, which left thousands of passengers stranded at Kaflavik airport in March 2019 when it declared bankruptcy and suddenly ceased operations . While traditional airlines are not perfect , they try to stick to relatively strict flight schedules and allow passengers to view their plane seats ahead of time. Low-cost airlines, on the other hand, reserve the right to make last-minute flight timing and seating changes, without due warning.",

Who wouldn’t prefer spending their hard-earned money on the reason(s) they are flying – be it hotel, shopping, or exotic destination – than on the flight itself?

Intercontinental flights (on legacy carriers) typically include luggage for both North American airlines and those based elsewhere. The target demographics of legacy (or full-service or whatever name you prefer for non-LCC) carriers is different from that of low-cost carriers (LCCs.) LCCs target primarily infrequent leisure travelers who choose flights primarily based on lowest price, even if the flights are less convenient and less reliable. Interlining agreements between airlines, especially those within an alliance, also often include allowing passengers to through-check their bags across multiple carriers instead of needing to re-check at connections. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between legacy carriers and LCCs is that legacy carriers typically have extensive loyalty programs designed to entice their highest-profit customers to keep their flying within that airline and its partners rather than shopping around for the cheapest flight for each trip."

Items like personal cubicles or designated workstations that seemed like a better fit for the \"private office\" argument will start making an appearance in these spaces as a way to keep employees safe and productive. Closed spaces or private offices have been observed to enhance concentration and possibly productivity by minimizing the distractions (noise, movement) that may naturally occur in open-space environments. While there can be significant savings in the successful implementation of a well-designed open-space work environment, unless you're creating a space that's specifically designed to fit your company's business, mission, and culture, the savings could be for nothing.

If you’ve tried open offices, but they’re leading to low employee satisfaction or reduced productivity, then modular structures allow for a fast solution. Allied Modular specializes in these kinds of fixes, and provides businesses the ability to customize their office layouts the way they see fit.

We believe other people experience feelings like us because they are like us in appearance and behaviour. An animal sharing our anatomical, physiological, and behavioural characteristics is surely likely to have feelings like us. If people have a right to not be harmed, we must ask ourselves what makes animals different?

Kahn, who studies retail, brand management and loyalty and related issues, said some specialty retail category killers and department stores are in a concerning position five years post-pandemic. As Macy’s closes stores, for example, Kahn said that retailer is trying to find the right balance between stores, e-commerce online shopping experience and exactly what a department store should offer in the post-COVID environment.

And, of course, make sure to communicate the benefit of crowdsourcing to your team — it should be a welcome help, not a threat, to their work. In order to ensure your data and work are safe, make sure the crowdsourcing partner you choose doesn't provide their members with access to real data sets.
