      "content": "**The climate science is clear\u2014the world must slash greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2050.** As such, we need practical policy solutions that will mitigate the impacts of climate change by quickly cutting and capturing carbon pollution and ensuring we are able to adapt to the impacts we cannot avoid. Adopting and applying the principles of climate-smart conservation can help natural resource managers ensure that our lands and waters continue supporting the needs of both people and wildlife. Smart investments in our nation\u2019s energy, industrial, transportation, water, and natural infrastructure systems can increase community safety and resilience, protect and recover wildlife, boost local economies and family-sustaining jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
