Despite how the pair may be portrayed within fan art on the internet, their relationship is a toxic and abusive one. For example, in Suicide Squad's New 52 version of her, the Joker pushes Harley off a ledge and into a vat of chemicals to prove her devotion to him. His abuse persists over time; the Joker continuously manipulates Harley into doing his bidding, and he’ll never really love her, because his ultimate obsessive desire is the Batman. All Harley wants to do is put a smile on the Joker’s face, and her many misdeeds are a product of her desire to get the Joker to love her.",

It seems that we, as a society, are finally evolving from an environment that has long pushed sexual harassment under the rug to one that acknowledges that to create a brighter future, we must acknowledge our past. No matter why sexual predators and harassers, including talented and powerful men like Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and Les Moonves, adopted their inappropriate (and maybe even criminal) behavior, their recognition of it is the first step in correcting it and making amends with their victims, families, friends and fans. Society is only as strong as its weakest link. A public apology is an open letter saying the guilty are ready to learn; accepting a public apology says that society is ready to rebuild.",

Not to mention, with less shared office space also means fewer shared office supplies and physical interactions, an obvious plus when it comes to social distancing and lowering the risk of exposure to germs. Physical health aside, closed office space also improves employees’ emotional wellbeing, as they are less exposed to work-related stressors, including the need to appear in constant productivity. Indeed, it’s been suggested that employees working in closed offices tend to experience less age discrimination due to the exhibition of anxiety, cardiac issues and digestive problems caused by the stressful environment they are working in. These employees also experience less neurological problems, like vertigo, brought on by the busy open-space environment.",

Researchers at Harvard have found that open work environments negatively affect collaboration, actually reducing face-to-face interactions by 70%. Plus, fewer screens or walls between employees, can lead to increased employee interruption, reduced levels of concentration and lower levels of motivation. Since it can take as long as 23 minutes for employees to get back on task and return to a fully engaged state, closed office layouts seem like a smart option to boost (and maintain) levels of concentration.",

A recent study from Georgetown University and University of Chicago found that Mexico’s Prospera – a cash-transfer system conditional on parents sending their children to school and staying up-to-date with doctors’ appointments – led to greater increases in children’s educational attainment long-term. These children grew up to work an average of nine more hours a week than their counterparts who weren’t enrolled in the program, in addition to earning higher hourly wages. Another study found that kids who were covered by Medicaid later earned more money and required less welfare assistance as adults.
