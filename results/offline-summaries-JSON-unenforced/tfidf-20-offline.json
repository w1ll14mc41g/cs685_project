As such, don’t our feelings of déjà vu and the idea that history repeats itself support the notion that time is cyclical? If time were truly and naturally linear, wouldn’t we use linear, metric counting measures that proceed from a single starting point towards infinity, like distance measurements do?\n[Doc 981]: Time is linear because of the different and cumulative ways we can record and measure it. Our Smartphone stopwatches measure time in milliseconds. This may be an absurd level of precision for daily life, but it is increasingly important as we push the limits of human athletic performance. We can also measure time by counting the number of times the Earth goes around the Sun, just as humans have done for thousands of years. If counted, this shows linear progress from a starting point onward. Or we can measure the vibration of cesium-133 atoms, as is done to set International Atomic Time. That global standard is so accurate that it will take 1.4 million years for it to be off by a full second. These natural phenomena can be recorded in long, cumulative and linear sequences.\n[Doc 166]: Until recently, the lives of agricultural, nomadic, and even urban peoples were governed by the endlessly repeating seasonal round. Calendars, which portray time as a linear concept, are a recent phenomenon when compared to the long-term existence of our species. The earliest calendar may have developed as early as 10,000 years ago ; well-documented calendar systems don’t become common in the archaeological record until within the last 5,000 years. Our species is 200,000 years old; for at least 95% of humankind’s existence as a species, time was cyclical and circadian.\n[Doc 993]: Have you noticed that our calendar years, i.e., linear timeframes, are counted as cumulative units from a particular starting point? This is because annual calendars are used by the political and religious powers to mark events they deem important, like the birth of Jesus, not natural or physical events or processes, like the origin of life on earth. What’s the difference between the Hebrew, Chinese, Gregorian, and Mayan calendars? Ultimately, and from the perspective of time itself, not much. These calendars have different origins, starting points, counting systems, and holidays that are relevant only to people, not animals, plants, or the planet. In the end, each of these calendars is nothing more than a cultural construct based on local political, religious, scientific, and economic systems created by humans.\n[Doc 2202]: Frequently, a ban-whether or food, alcohol or forms of media- serves only to build interest in the things that has been prohibited. When a ban affects something that is a familiar part of everyday life that is generally regarded as benign, there is a risk that individuals may try to acquire the banned thing through other means. Having had their perspective in junk food defined partly by attractive, highly persuasive advertising, children are likely to adopt an ambivalent perspective on any attempt to restrict their dietary choices. The extreme contrast between the former popularity of vending machines in schools and the austere approach required by new policies may hamper schools’ attempts to convince pupils of the necessity and rationality of their decision. Even though schools may be able to coerce and compel their pupils to comply with disciplinary measures, they cannot stop children buying sweets outside of school hours. When rules at an Orange county school changed, and the cafeteria got rid of its sweets, the demand was still up high, so that the school had to figure out a way to fix the situation.

If unpaid internships were banned, businesses would still get unpaid workers (especially in coveted or over-populated industries), in a way which may be unregulated and unsupervised. By maintaining a system of unpaid internships that is transparent, we can make sure that businesses don’t take advantage of interns or keep people trapped in unpaid jobs without any outside knowledge.\n[Doc 1192]: If you support the idea of unpaid internships, it might be because you think they help people find jobs. But statistics by the National Association of Colleges (NACE) and Employers show that people who took unpaid internships were actually less likely to find a job than those who took paid internships. A student survey by NACE found that students completing an unpaid internship the year before graduation were more likely to be still seeking employment six months after receiving their degree than those who completed a paid internship. In addition, unpaid interns don’t seem to get any more job offers than their pals with intern experience at all.\n[Doc 284]: Many people who support unpaid internships argue that businesses can’t afford to offer paid internships. However, unpaid internships may be bad for business. Unpaid interns tend to feel that their work is unimportant because they aren’t being paid for it, consequently leading some to expend only a meager effort. This doesn’t establish long-term loyalty.

In fact, college students who had internships are 15% less likely to be unemployed in the years after graduating college than those who didn’t.\n[Doc 2499]: Colleges offer career services, internships, job shadowing, job fairs, and volunteer opportunities in addition to a wide variety of courses that may provide a career direction.

Under the status quo, it is simply illegal to use force or the threat of force to solicit information from a suspect, regardless of the charge. The moment that becomes something other than a complete ban then it puts an intolerable pressure on security officials to decide when it is justified and when it is not. The experience of Abu Grahib demonstrates how the use of abusive treatment can become routine, even trivial, all too quickly. If it is acceptable to use torture to prevent mass-murder, then why not murder? If for murder than why not rape?\nDoc 617: When respectable law enforcement institutions use torture, they risk damaging their hard-earned reputations and moral upstanding. The use of torture is a rejection of a democracy’s loyalty to abiding by societal rules and values. For example, torture directly contradicts the legal right to remain silent, which suspects are afforded when questioned. Citizens in Western countries trust that they’re living in a society where fair treatment and basic respect for human rights are a given. Therefore, when these ideals are compromised by organized government, the “good guys” sink to the level of those who threaten the very principles they are fighting to protect.\nDoc 264: Torture is acceptable if it can save the lives of fellow citizens in “ ticking-bomb ” scenarios. Whether it’s an issue of national security or the potential death of kidnapped babies and toddlers, torture might be the only means of eliciting crucial information fast enough to rescue the people at risk. Although torture may not be legal, 60-70% of Americans think that torturing suspected terrorists can be a justifiable way of extracting information from them. Imagine if someone with information on the 9/11 attacks were to be captured, and torturing information out of him would have saved the lives of every Twin Tower victim; should his captors refrain from torturing him? The answer seems like a no-brainer.\nDoc 535: When facing enemies that don’t subscribe to the rules of democracy and Western morals, governments may have to speak the language of their opponents to get results. Terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda don’t think twice about torturing their captives, and even have a manual to show members exactly what to do. During the Vietnam war, the North Vietnamese government re-purposed the Hoa Lo Prison in order to torture American POWs for information. If suspects (terrorists or otherwise) pose a threat to a nation and play by a different set of rules – rules that include the use of torture – the opposing government may have no choice but to do so as well. In fact, in some cases, torture may even be a deterrent to war, thus saving lives.\nDoc 383: In times of war, armies may do whatever is necessary in order to save their country. By the very act of enlisting in military combat, a soldier has agreed to put his life on the line and die for his people if that’s what’s required of him — and suffering from torture can be a facet of that. Basic military training alone, specifically in elite units, can often involve some form of psychological or physical torture by the hands of a soldier’s own army to help strengthen soldiers’ immunity for worst-case scenarios. Such prisoner-of-war training exercises are par for the course when countries are preparing for war. During actual war, all bets are off, and torture is often an unavoidable consequence.\nDoc 3761: \nDoc 848: \nDoc 1268: Internet access is not a fundamental right as recognized by any major human rights convention, if it can be called a right at all. After all, in a war zone few rights survive or can be curtailed at all. Preventing such an outcome at the expense of the temporary curtailment of some lesser rights is entirely justified.

Imagine if someone with information on the 9/11 attacks were to be captured, and torturing information out of him would have saved the lives of every Twin Tower victim; should his captors refrain from torturing him? The answer seems like a no-brainer.\nDoc 535: When facing enemies that don’t subscribe to the rules of democracy and Western morals, governments may have to speak the language of their opponents to get results. Terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda don’t think twice about torturing their captives, and even have a manual to show members exactly what to do. During the Vietnam war, the North Vietnamese government re-purposed the Hoa Lo Prison in order to torture American POWs for information. If suspects (terrorists or otherwise) pose a threat to a nation and play by a different set of rules – rules that include the use of torture – the opposing government may have no choice but to do so as well. In fact, in some cases, torture may even be a deterrent to war, thus saving lives.\nDoc 383: In times of war, armies may do whatever is necessary in order to save their country. By the very act of enlisting in military combat, a soldier has agreed to put his life on the line and die for his people if that’s what’s required of him — and suffering from torture can be a facet of that. Basic military training alone, specifically in elite units, can often involve some form of psychological or physical torture by the hands of a soldier’s own army to help strengthen soldiers’ immunity for worst-case scenarios. Such prisoner-of-war training exercises are par for the course when countries are preparing for war. During actual war, all bets are off, and torture is often an unavoidable consequence.\nDoc 3761: \nDoc 848: \nDoc 1268: Internet access is not a fundamental right as recognized by any major human rights convention, if it can be called a right at all. After all, in a war zone few rights survive or can be curtailed at all. Preventing such an outcome at the expense of the temporary curtailment of some lesser rights is entirely justified. Under current law, in most states, only the most fundamental of rights, like the",

We believe prostitution should be legal. By regulating brothels and the conditions for prostitution through regular health checks, condoms et cetera, we can make sure prostitutes are safe from HIV. In places where prostitution is illegal, it is merely driven underground; controlled by cartels and gangs. In this situation prostitutes live under no rights. If a sex worker contracts AIDS, a man or woman client using them will be at risk of contracting the virus, they then run the risk of not knowing that they have it, infecting other sexual partners and the cycle continues. Also let us not forget future children who contract the disease while in the uterus. So it is in countries where prostitution is illegal where we can’t keep sex workers safe from AIDS. In these countries prostitutes aren’t even allowed to be prostitutes. They tend to enter the profession because they have no other way of earning money or they may be forced to do it. On the other hand, if prostitution is legal and regulations are put in place, sex workers will be safer from STI’s and HIV/AIDS. Regular health checks will pick up any possible infections and there will be laws to protect the well-being of sex workers. What’s more, these laws will not only protect sex workers, but their clients too. Making prostitution legal will improve the work conditions of people who have to go into prostitution for one reason or another and will protect society from a further spreading of HIV/AIDS. This is a significant benefit to greater society and individual workers and clients.\n[Doc 3585]: The problem with the opposition proposal is that it is not mutually exclusive to legalising prostitution. It is perfectly possible for a Government to provide an education program and legalise prostitution at the same time, in fact that is what is done in places like New Zealand where prostitution is legal and we provide sex education in schools. In fact, legalising prostitution actually helps a wider education program. If the opp wants people to be properly educated about AIDS, then they should not want to exclude and stigmatise sex workers. If you continue to ban prostitution, then it actually entrenches the idea that prostitutes are somehow lesser people whose welfare we shouldn’t care about when it comes to HIV. As it is, countries that ban prostitution make no effort to protect prostitutes at all. To have a free and open discussion, it is necessary to allow a free discussion about prostitution, which can only happen if it is legal. If it is not, it is much more difficult to acquire information about prostitutes and about the conditions in which they work, because they are less willing to come forward and admit to what they are doing. The opp has conceded that there is a problem of people having unsafe sex with prostitutes, and yet it seems like the only group of people they want to exclude from their education program are the prostitutes themselves. If we can identify who the prostitutes are, then we can educate them. If prostitution is illegal and forced underground, we can’t provide them with info. In addition, we can’t provide information with people who use prostitutes, both because they won’t admit to committing an illegal act and because banning prostitution increases the stigma on these people. The prop has missed the point entirely when they say we will be unable to enforce regulation, because it will be in the interests of the prostitutes and brothels to abide by regulations and report those who don’t.\n[Doc 427]: When the Netherlands legalized prostitution in 2000, one of its main objectives was to curtail human trafficking and the criminal prostitution enterprise. In spite of its best intentions, illegal brothels still proliferated and prostitutes continued to suffer abuses at the hands of pimps. The government is continuing to try to clean up the Red Light District by relocating its sex workers, but they fear this forced change may further put their rights and safety at risk.

It remains the interest of a minority, who should not be allowed to block the interests of society as a whole in gun control. Compensation can be given to individual gun owners, gun clubs and the retail firearms trade, in recognition of their economic loss if a ban is implemented.\n[Doc 994]: When the law meant to protect you, instead, turns you into prey, it’s understandable to want to take self-defense into your own hands. In Chicago, where there are bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, and where gun shops were banned until 2012, gun control laws are not proving effective. Though the city has some of the toughest gun restrictions in place, it suffers from rising gun and gang violence. The city’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is working to increase public safety, but has an uphill battle. Chicago is just one example of many cities where law-abiding citizens are paying the price – with their lives – of ineffective gun control laws.\n[Doc 1199]: Gun ownership exercises a fundamental individual right under the U.S. Constitution. For most upstanding citizens, owning a gun is as important to them as maintaining freedom of speech, the press, religion, among others. In fact, three quarters of gun owners believe that the right to bear arms is paramount to their freedom. No wonder gun owners take it personally when gun control laws appear to infringe on this right, thus impeding efforts to acquire firearms and protect themselves and their families. Plus, there’s the risk that certain proposed background checks may require government databases to keep gun owners’ personal information indefinitely. This could lead to future database searches unrelated to the information when it was first collected. This understandably can be perceived as an unfair invasion of privacy.\n[Doc 3018]: Stopping or slowing down a customer’s internet connection is an infringement on their freedom of expression and fundamental rights. The Open Rights group have claimed these new plans are a “curtailment of people’s freedom of expression.”\n[Doc 1268]: Internet access is not a fundamental right as recognized by any major human rights convention, if it can be called a right at all. After all, in a war zone few rights survive or can be upheld at all. Preventing such an outcome at the expense of the temporary curtailment of some lesser rights is entirely justified. Under current law, in most states, only the most fundamental of rights, like the right to life, prohibition against torture, slavery, and the right to a fair trial are regarded as inalienable.\n[Doc 1046]: If anything, gun restrictions are aimed at making the world safer by limiting guns from getting into the wrong hands. This leads to fewer deaths. Universal background checks on private and gun show sales, an issue that survivors of the February 2018 Parkland massacre helped push legislators to prioritize, can help prevent criminals and the mentally ill from getting guns. Research asserts that federal checks could cut gun deaths by an estimated 90%. And let’s not forget about mandatory safety features. Installing safety devices on guns would minimize accidental gun deaths, especially of and by children. Think about it: We have childproof caps on medicine bottles, so why not have childproof firearms?\n[Doc 1417]: Allowing teachers to carry arms in school could mean that very young children could easily become acclimatised to the idea that carrying a gun and ultimately gun usage is ok. Surely the way to prevent incidents like Columbine from happening is to teach children about the potentially destructive and fatal consequences of gun usage? For elementary/primary school-age children, it would be difficult to separate the idea that it’s ok for teachers to always carry guns but not for anyone else.\n[Doc 2519]: A Nov. 2009 peer-reviewed study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that someone carrying a gun for self-defense was 4.5 times",

Compensation can be given to individual gun owners, gun clubs and the retail firearms trade, in recognition of their economic loss if a ban is implemented.\n[Doc 994]: When the law meant to protect you, instead, turns you into prey, it’s understandable to want to take self-defense into your own hands. In Chicago, where there are bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, and where gun shops were banned until 2012, gun control laws are not proving effective. Though the city has some of the toughest gun restrictions in place, it suffers from rising gun and gang violence. The city’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is working to increase public safety, but has an uphill battle. Chicago is just one example of many cities where law-abiding citizens are paying the price – with their lives – of ineffective gun control laws.\n[Doc 1199]: Gun ownership exercises a fundamental individual right under the U.S. Constitution. For most upstanding citizens, owning a gun is as important to them as maintaining freedom of speech, the press, religion, among others. In fact, three quarters of gun owners believe that the right to bear arms is paramount to their freedom. No wonder gun owners take it personally when gun control laws appear to infringe on this right, thus impeding efforts to acquire firearms and protect themselves and their families. Plus, there’s the risk that certain proposed background checks may require government databases to keep gun owners’ personal information indefinitely. This could lead to future database searches unrelated to the information when it was first collected. This understandably can be perceived as an unfair invasion of privacy.\n[Doc 3018]: Stopping or slowing down a customer’s internet connection is an infringement on their freedom of expression and fundamental rights. The Open Rights group have claimed these new plans are a “curtailment of people’s freedom of expression.”\n[Doc 1268]: Internet access is not a fundamental right as recognized by any major human rights convention, if it can be called a right at all. After all, in a war zone few rights survive or can be upheld at all. Preventing such an outcome at the expense of the temporary curtailment of some lesser rights is entirely justified. Under current law, in most states, only the most fundamental of rights, like the right to life, prohibition against torture, slavery, and the right to a fair trial are regarded as inalienable.\n[Doc 1046]: If anything, gun restrictions are aimed at making the world safer by limiting guns from getting into the wrong hands. This leads to fewer deaths. Universal background checks on private and gun show sales, an issue that survivors of the February 2018 Parkland massacre helped push legislators to prioritize, can help prevent criminals and the mentally ill from getting guns. Research asserts that federal checks could cut gun deaths by an estimated 90%. And let’s not forget about mandatory safety features. Installing safety devices on guns would minimize accidental gun deaths, especially of and by children. Think about it: We have childproof caps on medicine bottles, so why not have childproof firearms?\n[Doc 1417]: Allowing teachers to carry arms in school could mean that very young children could easily become acclimatised to the idea that carrying a gun and ultimately gun usage is ok. Surely the way to prevent incidents like Columbine from happening is to teach children about the potentially destructive and fatal consequences of gun usage? For elementary/primary school-age children, it would be difficult to separate the idea that it’s ok for teachers to always carry guns but not for anyone else.\n[Doc 2519]: A Nov. 2009 peer-reviewed study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that someone carrying a gun for self-defense was 4.5 times",

If a school wants its students not to have sex, it shouldn’t provide them with condoms to use during intercourse. Furthermore, making condoms available in schools might send the erroneous message to students that their teachers and parents are expecting them to engage in sexual activity.\n[Doc 765]: Condom distribution in high schools gives students a false sense of security when having sex. This is because most teenagers lack experience with condom implementation and use, causing the condoms to be extremely ineffective. When used perfectly every single time during sex, condoms are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. But people, especially teenagers, aren’t perfect, so, typically, condoms may only about 85% effective. Not to mention the fact that vulnerable teenage girls still have less control over condom use.\n[Doc 1160]: By providing condoms to students, high schools are taking away the due right of parents to decide whether their own teenage children should have access to contraception. To begin with, many parents don’t think that their adolescent children are emotionally or physically ready yet for sex. So, having schools introduce condom use to their teenagers pressures both the parents and teens into having conversations about sex that may feel premature. It may also interfere with a family’s values or religious beliefs. For instance, the Catholic Church and other conservative faiths oppose various forms of contraception. Parents who support the cause can provide condoms to their teenagers without having schools infringe on other families’ timelines of talking about sex and/or religious freedoms.\n[Doc 1029]: As teenagers are beginning to discover their sexual identities, providing condoms in high schools can help them establish the concept of safe sex as the norm and gives them the mandate to be responsible. Research shows that 60% of high schoolers have had sex by the time they graduate. Therefore, introducing the idea of condom use into their conscience at such a formative age may help teens view contraception as second nature as opposed to something that either gender will have to continually negotiate with future partners. Also worth noting, with the Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe V. Wade, access to abortion is getting more limited across the US, which only emphasizes the need for more access to condoms.\n[Doc 3536]: On the disparity between private and state schools, the correct way to improve the education for children in state schools is to spend more money on state schools, devote more time, energy and enthusiasm to them. Preventing a minority from having a certain type of education is not the way to help improve the majority’s education. By and large, the complaint is that private schools are doing well and providing a good education, whilst state schools lag behind. It is in all our interests to set the standard of education as high as we can – you do this by raising state schools to the supposed standard of private schools, not by depriving children of a private education.\n[Doc 2278]: State schools will, like the private schools, have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere. This incentivises in particular high level management, who, if the school fails, will be out of a job with a blot on their record.\n[Doc 671]: Among U.S. high school students surveyed by the CDC in 2021, 30% were sexually active. Of these, 48% of them didn’t use a condom during their last sexual encounter. The same study also showed that half of the 20 million new STDs reported in the United States each year are among 15- to 24-year-olds, and that people aged 13-24 accounted for an estimated 20% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2018.

It can also turn the entire surrogacy process into a physical act lacking in emotional attachment This is because surrogates might be compelled to sell their bodies and their function for money, while attempting to distance themselves from the significance of their acts and shield themselves from potential postpartum heartbreak.\n[Doc 520]: Today, approximately 11% of American women struggle with infertility. For people unable to conceive due to infertility or medical conditions, surrogacy can be one of the only ways in which they finally create a family. Surrogacy can help single men and women and LGBT couples become parents, enabling at least one parent to be biologically linked to their child. Plus, having kids and forming a family has been positively linked with increased parental happiness, productivity and longevity, for all family members. Some research even suggests that parents are happier than non-parents later in life, once their children move out. Basically, surrogacy can create the foundation for a happier, more fulfilled life.\n[Doc 430]: Surrogacy can be problematic in instances where it is used by wealthier people to dominate and degrade women from lower socio-economic backgrounds, particularly in third-world countries. The woman’s unique childbearing capabilities are recognized and used to bring money in. The issue of consent is at times unclear. Countries like India offer surrogacy services to Western countries at a fraction of the cost, which can be seen as exploiting women as baby-making machines for a pittance. The low price tag can be tempting to couples and individuals of higher economic means who are desperate to expand their families, driving them to enter into surrogacy agreements with third-world women, despite the way these contracts may affect these surrogates. In Ukraine, for example, couples may pay anywhere between $30K-$50K for the process while the surrogate mothers reportedly receive only a small fraction of this sum.\n[Doc 379]: To better understand surrogacy, we must look at the alternatives available to people hoping to become parents. One alternative is adoption. Despite there being many children around the world in desperate need of homes, it can take years for a single child to be adopted. Then, adoptive parents must get to know a child who is already born and who biologically belongs to someone else. It may also be challenging to find out a comprehensive health history of the adopted child, which may cause complications later in life for everyone involved. Clearly, adoption is not easy. While the surrogacy process can also be challenging, especially when the surrogate mother is in a different country where war can break out, surrogacy does ensure that intended parents can be involved in their child’s life from the get-go. Intended parents are updated on the surrogate’s pregnancy, and often can attend scans and be present when the baby, often theirs biologically, is born.\n[Doc 1075]: In countries that allow and support commercial surrogacy, surrogate mothers are fairly compensated for their time and the medical risk involved. These women are instructed about the process, what medical procedures are required and how they must conduct themselves throughout the gestational period. Contracts are signed to protect the surrogate and intended parents to ensure that all parties get what they want. For the intended parents, this means a baby. For the regulated surrogate – a base compensation of around $25,000 can be expected, though it can be more and the absolving of her responsibility towards the child and its intended parents following childbirth. From an equality perspective, surrogate mothers are well informed and conscious of their choice. The act of surrogacy can therefore be viewed as an educated and informed economic opportunity.\n[Doc 503]: When surrogacy is allowed, babies become commodities for trade, often between wealthy Westerners and impoverished families in developing countries.

For example, the IRS treats Bitcoin as property and taxes it as such. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is both decentralized – meaning it has no central role of management or authority – and unstable. Some may see its decentralization as a good thing, but this opened it up for black market trading in the past. In fact, in 2016, over 10% of Bitcoin transactions happened on The Silk Road, a hidden online service (which is now defunct ) that allowed for trading drugs, illegal substances, and other illicit activities. In 2020, $1 billion in bitcoin was said to be linked to criminal activity.\n[Doc 456]: As of now, Bitcoin has the potential to become an environmental disaster. While it may seem like it saves resources, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Tracker currently shows that Bitcoin consumes 146.86 Terawatt hours per year, and that number is only going up. To put that in perspective, that’s comparable to the annual power consumption of Ukraine or the annual carbon footprint of Romania, and one Bitcoin transaction could cost as much water as a backyard swimming pool. Currently, the amount of energy it takes to “mine” (i.e., create) and use Bitcoin is unsustainable in the long term.\n[Doc 655]: Bitcoin is catching on, regardless of any personal aversion to it. It is already considered as one of the world’s top currencies and is becoming more and more mainstream; Elon Musk’s Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in 2021 while certain colleges even accept it as payment. In fact, there are reports that JPMorgan, among others on Wall Street, are accepting Bitcoin as an asset class. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve is reportedly creating a bank-to-bank digital currency, proving just how relevant Bitcoin already is to the future of currency.\n[Doc 719]: Many see the overall rise in Bitcoin prices as a bubble, due to its volatility. In finance terms, a “bubble” is when the price of an asset far surpasses its fundamental value, implying that its preliminary spike in value will eventually crash and burn. For example, in 2008, the U.S. housing bubble popped, leading to an economic crisis, which became the Great Recession. In this vein, whenever Bitcoin prices drop, experts warn that they will only continue to fall, especially in the long run, even after temporary recoveries. Also, Bitcoin takes money and power away from institutions that are used to being in charge – namely, banks and governments. It’s reasonable to assume that given all the revenues they stand to lose, they won’t take this lying down; they have all the resources in the world at their disposable to combat the success of virtual currency.\n[Doc 148]: Bitcoin has allowed people to put their trust in technology instead of third-party mediators like banks and civil-law notaries. This is because it relies on blockchain technology, which is a complex mathematical model that instantly creates a virtual chain of recorded transactions when Bitcoin is transferred from one place to another. These transactions are easily verifiable, and will eliminate the possibility of human error, steep transaction fees, and long wait times when transferring money. In other words, Bitcoin makes the whole process of using money more efficient by cutting out the middlemen who have had to oversee every transaction that takes place thus far. This is why mainstream payment firms like PayPal are not only investing in it but offering it as an option to their platform.\n[Doc 621]: Illustrious investor Warren Buffet has long warned people to “never invest in a business you cannot understand.” He has advised to only invest in companies that you already know about, which is difficult to do with small-change apps that often invest in companies of their choosing.
