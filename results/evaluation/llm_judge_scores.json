      "raw_response": "1. **Claim-Perspective Alignment**: Each perspective has a clear claim about surrealist memes (progression vs. regression) and a linked rationale. Perspective 1 supports progression by framing memes as an evolution from Dadaism and Pop Art; Perspective 2 supports regression by framing memes as a nostalgic throwback lacking resonance and social commentary. Score: 2\n\n2. **Evidence Support**: Evidence document IDs are provided for both perspectives, which is appropriate for sourcing claims. While we cannot verify the contents of the documents here, the inclusion of IDs suggests there is an attempt to ground each perspective in references. Score: 2\n\n3. **Perspective Distinctiveness**: The two perspectives present opposing viewpoints with distinct rationales and little redundant content beyond the core topic. They are genuinely different positions (progression vs. regression). Score: 2\n\n4. **Query Coverage**: The perspectives address the central debate implied by the query\u2014whether surrealist memes signify progression or regression\u2014covering multiple angles (evolution from earlier art movements vs. nostalgia and resonance). While not exhaustive, they reasonably cover the key dimensions of the debate. Score: 2\n\n5. **Content Groundedness**: The claims are plausible and framed in a grounded way, referencing recognizable art movements and concepts. There are no evident fabrications or implausible assertions within the given content. Score: 2\n\nRating: [[10]]"

      "raw_response": "1. **Claim-Perspective Alignment**: Explanation: Perspective 1 claims Friends is better; the perspective argues that Friends is more influential and set the bar for successful sitcoms, which is a plausible rationale for being \u201cbetter,\u201d though it\u2019s a somewhat indirect metric. Perspective 2 claims Seinfeld is better; it argues Seinfeld revolutionized television with unique storytelling and memorable secondary characters. Both perspectives provide a rationale that aligns with their respective claims, but the alignment could be stronger with more explicit, concrete criteria (e.g., ratings, longevity, genre impact). Score: 1\n\n2. **Evidence Support**: Explanation: Evidence Document IDs are provided for both perspectives, which is appropriate and indicates an attempt to back claims. However, without access to the actual content of those documents, we cannot confirm how well the references support the specific points. The mere presence of IDs is positive, but true support cannot be verified here. Score: 1\n\n3. **Perspective Distinctiveness**: Explanation: The two perspectives present opposing claims (Friends vs. Seinfeld) and rely on different rationales: influence/assification for Friends, and revolutionary storytelling for Seinfeld. They are clearly distinct with limited redundancy. Score: 2\n\n4. **Query Coverage**: Explanation: The response addresses the core debate by presenting two sides of the throwback-TV question. However, it offers only two narrow angles and does not explore additional dimensions (cultural impact, humor style, audience reception, era context, or critical consensus) that could provide a more comprehensive view. Score: 1\n\n5. **Content Groundedness**: Explanation: The statements are within broadly accepted views and do not appear to fabricate details. They stay at a high level and avoid implausible or nonsensical claims. Score: 2\n\nRating: [[7]]"

Both perspectives elaborate on their respective claims, providing a rationale that supports the stance. Score: 2\n\n2. **Evidence Support**: Evidence document IDs are provided for both perspectives, indicating explicit references.

While we cannot verify the content of the documents here, the presence of IDs and the pairing with each perspective is appropriate.

They appear to offer separate, non-redundant angles. Score: 2\n\n4. **Query Coverage**: The two perspectives cover the major sides of the debate (negative critique vs positive support). However, the coverage is limited to these two angles and omits other dimensions (e.g., participant welfare specifics, ethical considerations, viewer impact). Partial but reasonable coverage.

Perspective 1 supports a critical view due to controversies; Perspective 2 supports a positive view focusing on artistic innovation. This alignment is coherent and each perspective elaborates the associated claim. Score: 2\n\n2. **Evidence Support**: Evidence document IDs are provided for both perspectives ([528, 961] for Perspective 1; [362, 416] for Perspective 2), which suggests that references exist to back the claims. The presence of IDs is appropriate, though the actual sufficiency and relevance of the documents cannot be assessed without content. Score: 2\n\n3. **Perspective Distinctiveness**: The two perspectives are clearly distinct: one emphasizes critique and controversy, the other emphasizes artistic achievement and impact. There is minimal irrelevant overlap, and they present opposing stances rather than redundant content. Score: 2\n\n4. **Query Coverage**: The perspectives cover the main angles on the query \u201cHow Should We View Michael Jackson\u2019s legacy?\u201d by presenting both a critical assessment and an artistic/innovative appraisal. While not exhaustively exhaustive, they offer a balanced dual-view coverage of the topic. Score: 2\n\n5. **Content Groundedness**: The content references widely discussed themes (controversies and artistic impact) without making unverified factual claims beyond the claims themselves. However, some wording\u2014such as \u201cbizarre behavior\u201d\u2014is subjective and could border on sensationalism. Overall, it remains grounded but with individual statements that could be better framed as opinions. Score: 1\n\nRating: [[9]]"

There is no clear logical elaboration connecting the consumerism claim to the stated moral/value concern, and the two items are not coherently aligned. Additionally, both perspectives are identical, offering no distinct support for the claim. Score: 0\n\n2. **Evidence Support**: Evidence document IDs are provided for both perspectives ([462, 672]), and having references is appropriate. However, there is no accessible or verifiable content to assess whether these documents actually support the perspectives. Without visibility into the sources, the support remains indeterminate. Score: 1\n\n3. **Perspective Distinctiveness**: The two perspectives are exact duplicates with the same claim and the same elaboration, offering no genuine distinct viewpoints. Score: 0\n\n4. **Query Coverage**: The evaluation only offers a negative angle (consumerism and detriment to values) and does not cover multiple facets of the query \u201cAre they good for children?\u201d (e.g., educational value, age-appropriateness, positives, varied moral lessons, diversity/representation). Score: 0\n\n5. **Content Groundedness**: The content presents normative judgments (consumerism, impact on morals) without concrete grounding in cited evidence within the text. While not obviously fabricated, the lack of substantive, verifiable support makes the content only partially grounded. Score: 1\n\nRating: [[2]]"

Perspective 1 claims Jack could fit, but its listed reasons actually suggest the opposite (smaller/less buoyant/more limited), creating a mismatch between the claim and its elaboration. Overall, alignment is partial rather than fully coherent. Score: 1\n\n2. **Evidence Support**: Both perspectives provide document IDs (Perspective 1: [331, 134], Perspective 2: [464, 134, 722]). The inclusion of references is appropriate for each perspective and suggests support, though the actual content of the sources cannot be verified here.

They are clearly distinct and do not simply restate the same point.

They address the core aspects from different angles, contributing to broader coverage. Score: 2\n\n5. **Content Groundedness**: Some claims rely on commonly discussed theories or interpretations (e.g., buoyancy debates, script wording) but parts (e.g., \u201cthe door was not as buoyant as depicted\u201d or \u201cthe script says Jack gets off the door\u201d) may verge into speculation or misrepresentation.
